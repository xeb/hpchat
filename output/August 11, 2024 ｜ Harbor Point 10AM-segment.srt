1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ. Come on, put those hands.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's sing.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you believe, won't you put them together?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By His blood, I have been severed.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I believe in resurrection.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's sing all praise.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hallelujah, yes I do.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hallelujah, I believe in Him.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I believe in the hope of heaven.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's preparing the place for me.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Far beyond my heart's imagine.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here's a bird and night I see.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I believe that He's going.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
His return is to blame, it's bright.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Light the altar, keep it burning.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
See the light, the rose of holy light, yeah.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000

All praise to the Holy Spirit.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Our God has overblown.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe, yeah.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I believe in You, Lord, and I trust You.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I believe in You, though I'll never be ashamed.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How could I ever walk away?

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Will the Word have saved my life?

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, I'll never.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000

From the Word who saves my life?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, I'll never.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How could I ever walk away?

All praise to the Holy Spirit.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Our God has overblown.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

48

I believe in you.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How can you believe in Jesus today?

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Won't you give him some praise?

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We serve a God that is more than able.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
abundantly, a baffle who can ask for things,

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
who continue in our worship and sing unto the Lord,

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who trust you to depend on the Lord.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The Son, when did I start to forget

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
all of the great things you did?

60
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And when did I think, oh, wait,

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and think for him in possible love?

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And how did I start to believe

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that you were sufficient for me?

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And why do I talk my sick?

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How can I forgive you?

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How can you believe in God?

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You see, that you are more than able.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You see, that you are more than able.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Say it again.

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You are more than able.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh, here are people today,

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
but we declare that you are more than able.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So who are you to deny what the Lord can do?

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because it's easy for you.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And now I see more than I have.

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, I got my confidence back, yeah.

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I put my trust in the one who still does miracle,

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
who do miracles.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are more than able.

You are more than able.

83
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's make a round to this place where our God shows.

You are more than able.

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Anything is possible with the clergy there.

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Anything is possible.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000

Yes, Jesus.

118
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What a God we serve.

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We're gonna sing a new song.

120
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's called You Keep Hope Alive.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's very easy.

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I'm gonna teach you first.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's all proclaiming the hope that is in Jesus.

Because we have hope in Him.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hope to live for tomorrow.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hope to stand in this world.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
See, day makes me darkest.

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But your light is greater.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You will light our way.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
God, you will light our way.

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And with evil it's rising.

Jesus, you are alive.

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Death had a strong hope.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And your light is stronger.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're always strong.

145
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000

You're rising higher.

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We're the power to save.

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on, you got that.

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000

And your light is stronger.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You keep hope alive.

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because you're living hope.

164
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Because you're breathing this hope.

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000

For this moment alone.

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Give the morning hope.

170
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000

In the silent hope.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For this moment alone.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
For tomorrow.

You keep hope alive.

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
From the beginning to when your word never fails.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You keep hope alive.

187
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because you are alive.

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Jesus, you are alive.

189
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Jesus, you are alive.

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You keep hope alive.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You keep hope alive.

192
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
From the beginning to when your word never fails.

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You keep hope alive.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because you are alive.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Jesus, you are alive.

196
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You are alive.

197
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are alive.

198
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't you rest in it.

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't have to worry about a thing.

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because you're alive.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You keep hope alive.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You keep hope alive.

203
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In the middle of the storm.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're standing right there with me.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
In the middle of the fire.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You keep hope alive.

207
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Thank you, Lord.

208
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If my grandma was here, she wouldn't sing it like this.

209
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
She would sing because she lives.

210
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can face tomorrow.

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because Jesus lives.

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
All of my fears, they're gone.

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because I know, I know, I know.

214
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He holds you in His future in life.

215
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's worth living just because Jesus lives.

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's an old song.

217
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm 33, but I got an old soul.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I love those songs.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Can I say one more time?

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just receive it.

221
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Receive it.

222
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let it encourage your spirit.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You do.

224
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Back in the black church.

225
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We used to sing songs of people and people would get excited because it was the truth.

226
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Because he lives.

227
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can face tomorrow because Jesus lives.

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
All my fears, they're gone.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I

230
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,740
know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

231
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,160
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I heard, I know,

232
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,080
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

233
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,600
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

234
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,780
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

235
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,860
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

236
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,440
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

237
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,080
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

238
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,840
Get off the stage.

239
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,240
Y'all, hey, oh, I love you too.

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,320
I love you too.

241
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,880
Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today.

242
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
This is an amazing church.

243
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,880
So glad.

244
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,520
I'm singing with my sister, Brittany, who is Kobe's wife.

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,680
And she's singing for the first time in, what, four or five

246
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,320
years?

247
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,820
Jesus.

248
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,920
Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back.

249
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,160
We got the same alma mater in Ohio.

250
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,200
And when I got my first job out of college,

251
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,360
I was living with them in Houston, Texas.

252
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,880
And they let me live there like a little brother for free,

253
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,440
just trying to find my way.

254
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,600
Somehow, I got myself out to California because of Kobe.

255
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,440
And it's cool.

256
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,320
Like, in this moment, I've been singing here and there

257
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,880
here now.

258
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,640
We're getting to lead and love God together again.

259
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
So I'm so grateful for both of you.

260
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,640
Love you, Kobe.

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,760
Don't y'all love Kobe?

262
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,840
I ain't going to say nothing smart this time.

263
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,280
All right.

264
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,600
Well, I love you too.

265
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
And why don't you tell some people around you.

266
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,040
I love you.

267
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,360
And then you may have a seat.

268
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today.

269
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
We're so glad you're here.

270
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,640
At Harbor Point, giving us more than just a financial

271
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
transaction.

272
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,360
It's part of our worship.

273
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a tangible, exceptional, and we're

274
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,880
very grateful that you've come here.

275
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,660
And you're here today.

276
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,440
So thank you.

277
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
And thanks for joining us.

278
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,100
We're so glad you're here.

279
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,400
At Harbor Point, giving us more than just a financial

280
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,240
transaction.

281
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,920
It's part of our worship.

282
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,400
It's a tangible, exceptional, and it's

283
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,720
an exceptional tour.

284
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,400
It's a tangible expression of our devotion and gratitude to God, demonstrating that our

285
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,240
hearts are centered on Him.

286
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,520
Each week we bring our offerings as an expression of our commitment to God's work in and through

287
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,040
His Church.

288
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,280
Whether this is your first time giving or you're continuing your giving, please take

289
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,920
a look at the various ways you can contribute.

290
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,480
Thank you for your generosity.

291
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,040
We're thrilled to continue our summer series at the Movies.

292
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,200
This year you can enjoy At The Movies at two locations, the Regency Theatre in San Juan

293
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,360
on Sundays at 10am and at Harbor Point for our regular weekend services and don't forget

294
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,240
Encore, bringing our At The Movies experience to Regency Theatre on Thursday nights at 6.30pm.

295
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:33,120
It's a fantastic opportunity to invite your friends, neighbors, and coworkers.

296
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,680
If you've been a part of Harbor Point for a while, you've heard us say that every good

297
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:42,520
thing that we do is done through great volunteers, and that's you.

298
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,100
When I think of some of the amazing volunteers, I think of Travis and Tina, who serve so faithfully

299
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,600
on our worship team for Harbor Point's VBS.

300
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:57,720
We're so grateful for how they gave their time and talents to pour into the next generation.

301
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,600
So if you're already serving at Harbor Point, we would love to say thank you.

302
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,320
Or if you're curious about what it might look like to step into serving, we want to

303
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,600
invite you to our volunteer rally and lunch, Sunday August 18th at 12.45pm.

304
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:19,800
You can register today through our app or online or through the QR code in front of you.

305
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,940
Men of Harbor Point Man Camp 2024 is just a few weeks away.

306
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,120
This transformative retreat will offer a unique opportunity to step away from the daily life

307
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,680
and connect with God and other men in our community.

308
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:41,880
You'll experience powerful worship, inspiring messages, and build lasting friendships.

309
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:48,000
Man Camp will take place at Forest Home from August 23rd to 25th.

310
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,920
As summer comes to a close, student ministries will be holding their end of summer celebrations

311
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,960
over the next couple weeks.

312
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,640
High school will be celebrating with a beach bonfire at Dohini on Thursday, August 15th.

313
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,360
Junior High will be holding their summer celebration here on campus on Thursday, August 22nd.

314
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,240
For more information and to sign up, just scan the QR codes in front of you or go online

315
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
to our website.

316
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,200
We would love to see you in person for our at the movie series here at Harbor Point campus

317
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,640
or the Regency Theater, but we thank you so much for joining us online today for our series

318
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,360
on anxiety called A Bag of Angry Bees.

319
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
All right, hey everybody, how's it going?

320
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,920
Yeah, you guys chose, you chose the 10 o'clock service.

321
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
You love traffic.

322
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
You felt like it's raining.

323
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,280
We could get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way.

324
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,420
Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately, like how am I going to put to

325
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,320
test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus, but to find a parking lot that's

326
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,000
miserable and work my way out of it.

327
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And you did it.

328
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You found it.

329
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Way to go.

330
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Glad you guys made it.

331
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Those of you guys who are in the tent, glad you guys made it.

332
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well.

333
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,680
It is so good to be with you guys.

334
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,120
And for those of you guys who are online, of course, we say this every single week.

335
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,040
The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to

336
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,360
be together, because the people of our church are amazing.

337
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
And really, you guys are.

338
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm really grateful to be with you guys.

339
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
So fun.

340
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,840
And I know you had to drive today through a puddle.

341
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,920
You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car.

342
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
And you made it.

343
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
It's incredible.

344
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
So great stuff happened.

345
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
And let's get right to it.

346
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,120
We have a lot to cover as we talk about this.

347
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,120
By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff, and I just want to make sure we're clear.

348
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
We do not have all the answers.

349
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
This is not a church.

350
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
We have everything figured out.

351
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Here's what we know.

352
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
We're looking at Jesus.

353
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,260
We believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus, and that requires everybody

354
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,200
to help us along the way.

355
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,280
Everybody's got a next step in that.

356
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,640
So whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus, you're investigating the church

357
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take.

358
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,240
And our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all

359
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
together.

360
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,200
We're a work in progress kind of people doing that stuff.

361
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,320
So however that is, grateful that you're here.

362
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Let's get right to it.

363
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,680
I'm going to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention

364
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
as you watch this commercial.

365
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,680
Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person, okay?

366
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,520
But I recognize it, it's fine.

367
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,120
But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial.

368
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Check this out, okay?

369
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Here we go.

370
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,440
Mary Clary, thanks for her zipper bags are the best, and we'll never switch to Gladlock

371
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
zipper bags.

372
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
That's right, never.

373
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,640
And Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here with either your

374
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,080
bag filled with angry bees or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees?

375
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,160
See that green color chain seal there, Mary?

376
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,120
That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed.

377
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,320
Your bag doesn't have a green seal.

378
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,840
You know, change is good.

379
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag.

380
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Just kidding, Mary.

381
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,320
When it really counts, don't get mad.

382
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,760
Get Gladlock zipper bags.

383
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,800
Okay, some of you remember this commercial.

384
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,440
Now, what I want to, obviously this is, it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over

385
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,680
analyzing it and taking it way too seriously, okay?

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
That's the gift I bring.

387
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,680
But let's look at this for a moment.

388
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,520
This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice.

389
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,640
Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which

390
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
makes the green thing, which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was

391
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
so crucial.

392
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,360
And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag would you rather have hold

393
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,480
the angry bees that we're going to give you?

394
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,200
And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed

395
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
to do this.

396
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,920
The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea that these

397
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,240
people who are making this scenario happen not only have they got bees to give a person

398
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,280
to hold, but also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth.

399
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,960
And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is, it's like an elevator that

400
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
doesn't go anywhere.

401
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,960
That's all that it is.

402
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
It's the same thing.

403
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,680
It's not a phone, but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there.

404
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,120
But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which

405
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,880
they're agreeing to do.

406
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,200
And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

407
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away?

408
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,880
I don't want to do any of this.

409
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,520
I don't care what bag you use.

410
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm not doing this.

411
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
This whole thing is stupid.

412
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,040
The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her

413
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,040
in this thing.

414
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,000
How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that?

415
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,840
The question is, and why are people saying yes to this?

416
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,080
The question over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously.

417
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,560
The question is, well, who's in charge here?

418
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,080
Who thought this was a good idea?

419
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,480
Who thought this would be okay?

420
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,000
Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person

421
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
and says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth.

422
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,000
The whole thing is bizarre and absurd and who's in charge here?

423
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,040
Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety.

424
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,040
Who's in charge here?

425
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,280
We're in week two of a series called the bag of angry bees and it's a series on anxiety

426
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,000
because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees.

427
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But I want to catch us up a little bit.

428
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
If you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing field

429
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,400
as we talk about this idea of anxiety, one of the things we said last week was this,

430
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,960
is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety.

431
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,560
Fear is the response to something that has happened, like bear, person with a knife coming

432
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
after us.

433
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,960
Oh my gosh, that's fear.

434
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
Anxiety is what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?

435
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
That's anxiety.

436
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Are you with me?

437
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing.

438
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,720
And we said that generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing

439
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,560
that's happening or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern but in anxiety

440
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,440
we take that up to an unreasonable response level or an unreasonable sort of anticipation

441
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
level.

442
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Are you with me?

443
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,840
Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something

444
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,840
in common.

445
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,120
Anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty.

446
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,400
It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain.

447
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,040
And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

448
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,280
all of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety.

449
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,840
It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current

450
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,920
statistics on this, which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone,

451
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,680
you have someone in your house perhaps, or you yourself as someone who has anxiety.

452
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,560
And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you

453
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,920
grew up or what kind of healthy environment you might have encountered, some of you got

454
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,800
the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety, the best solution

455
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,320
is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it.

456
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it.

457
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,680
It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff, compensate by being high functioning

458
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,600
and just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it because you shouldn't

459
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,800
have to deal with it, just snap out of it.

460
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told

461
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,240
us, we were told, here's what you should do.

462
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,840
Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you, and then by comparison

463
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
you won't care anymore.

464
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,720
You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people.

465
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah, so I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either

466
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,800
of the anxieties, in either case.

467
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,200
And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like,

468
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,720
you know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower who maybe

469
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,800
they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know I'm suffering

470
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,480
from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression.

471
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,160
And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you, don't be anxious about anything.

472
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Thank you so much.

473
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,440
And they're like, well, don't be anxious, but in everything, in every situation by prayer

474
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,560
and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God.

475
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,480
And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that.

476
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,120
I guess I'm not supposed to have this because the solution to having anxiety is apparently

477
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
just don't.

478
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,600
And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal

479
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,800
with it as a shame thing because I'm not supposed to have it.

480
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,360
And so it never really gets dealt with at all.

481
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,920
The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level.

482
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:41,040
And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question, who's

483
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,160
in charge?

484
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,000
A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in

485
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
charge?

486
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,600
What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way, my feelings or my

487
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,680
thoughts are in charge.

488
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
I'm not in charge.

489
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Not me.

490
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
I'm not in charge.

491
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,080
And this is where it starts.

492
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
This is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue.

493
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,360
In other words, probably another way to say it is this.

494
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,840
Anxiety has a double effect.

495
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety,

496
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,160
to say it this way.

497
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,040
I'm freaking out about freaking out.

498
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,120
And this is why people get stuck in it.

499
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,600
It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough.

500
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,640
It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety, like what am I supposed to do with this thing

501
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,400
when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral and you maybe have this experience

502
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,760
or do you know people who do?

503
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,760
And here's what I want to do today.

504
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,480
I want to give us one tool.

505
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,040
It's not the answer to everything.

506
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,400
It doesn't solve all the anxiety.

507
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,960
It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool that also requires a pretty

508
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,320
significant amount of courage as well.

509
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,040
It's just going to, and just again, to make sure we reiterate, I'm not an expert.

510
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,680
Someone told you we're doing a series on anxiety.

511
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,720
You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure

512
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,280
about Jesus, but I will come hear that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on

513
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
this.

514
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm not a therapist.

515
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
This is not my degree.

516
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm a fellow traveler in this.

517
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,320
I do a little bit of research on some stuff.

518
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,280
I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing.

519
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,880
My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys.

520
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,040
But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today.

521
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,280
And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week.

522
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,600
But I also want to tell you this, fair warning.

523
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,560
The way we're going to get to this one tool is a very windy road.

524
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,920
Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes.

525
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,840
I don't appreciate the laughter.

526
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
It's fine.

527
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
It's fine.

528
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,680
But you're going to be like, what in the world are we doing?

529
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,200
And then I promise I will bring it back home.

530
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,240
But you're going to wonder for a little bit, because I'm going to start in a place you

531
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
may not expect.

532
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,800
And then we're going to get there.

533
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,840
So I'm going to start in ancient Near Eastern temple construction, because that's where

534
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
you thought I was going to go.

535
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Right in here.

536
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,840
That's where we'll start.

537
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,840
Here's what we're going to do.

538
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
I'm totally serious.

539
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,680
Ancient Near Eastern temple construction.

540
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Here's what happens.

541
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,800
The first of the phases starts like this.

542
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,000
It's the boundary making of a particular thing.

543
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Here's where things are.

544
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Here's where things are.

545
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,960
This separates the sacred space from the not-sacred space, boundary making.

546
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,520
Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filling of things and some further separation

547
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,520
of things.

548
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,600
There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces which are separated from other spaces.

549
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,280
All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East.

550
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,840
And the sixth phase of the temple construction, whatever it is, whatever god that's being

551
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,160
worshipped there, a statue typically is placed within there on the sixth phase.

552
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:27,400
So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation, sort of this creation

553
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,400
of a temple.

554
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,160
And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple to give people

555
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,880
an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple.

556
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,240
Now there are six days, there's a seven day creation, but there's a six day creation

557
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
narrative in the Bible.

558
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation.

559
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,800
So god created mankind in his own image and the image of god, he created them male and

560
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
female.

561
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,240
This is the sixth day of creation.

562
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,120
Now let me pause right here for a second.

563
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,200
What's being said by this, many scholars agree, that the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation

564
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,880
narrative in the Bible, which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that

565
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,240
yet, that's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this, that the whole cosmos,

566
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,600
the Bible will say, is god's temple, the entire thing.

567
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,600
No temple could contain him, so the whole cosmos is his temple and instead of a statue

568
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,680
on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day, it's a person, people become the representation

569
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,760
of this god in his temple, the whole cosmos.

570
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,940
But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28.

571
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:31,200
God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth

572
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,160
and subdue it, some translations, and have dominion over it.

573
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:40,000
Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and over every living creature

574
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,160
that moves on the ground.

575
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,200
So the people aren't just simply decoration, there's more there, they're blessed and they're

576
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,600
told to multiply and have dominion and the answer to the question, who's in charge of

577
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,520
all of the created stuff?

578
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,460
The answer is, people are.

579
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,560
People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation.

580
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,760
In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to is God himself.

581
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,520
Other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things.

582
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,880
It's a gift to Genesis chapter two, where it gets a little bit more specific about some

583
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
of this stuff.

584
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,640
Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all

585
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,760
the birds of the sky, and he brought them to the man to see what he would name them.

586
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,240
And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.

587
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,280
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.

588
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,600
Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man, this created, this image of

589
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:40,600
God placed into this whole cosmos, which now has this responsibility to name everything.

590
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,160
Again, this might be a challenge for some of you, like I'm not sure I believe, just

591
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,760
stay with the point of what's happening here, because here's what's happening in naming.

592
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,480
Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible.

593
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,400
Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this, the first thing

594
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,320
that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing.

595
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,000
So when someone names a thing, it says, this is a that and I'm not that.

596
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
That's not me.

597
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,240
Over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is, from me, that's separate from

598
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,740
me.

599
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,600
Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me, does that make sense?

600
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,960
This is differentiation, you're different than me, that's what's being said, when we

601
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
name a thing.

602
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,960
Secondly, what happens in naming is sort of an authority over.

603
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,360
Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing.

604
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,440
So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not

605
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,040
me, but it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named.

606
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,920
This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament,

607
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,400
the Old Covenant, part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really

608
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,560
interesting kind of conversation about names.

609
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,480
Not least of which is the name of God, which is kind of, if you read Moses' interaction

610
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,440
with God in the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before, but one

611
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,720
of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool, what do I tell people your name is as if to

612
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,480
say, because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed.

613
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,820
It's so unbelievably important and sacred, in fact, to this day.

614
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,840
You will find very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God, they'll

615
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,880
refer to God as this word, Hashem, who is in that word simply means the name.

616
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,000
Like we can't even, we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God, because it's

617
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,840
so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment, so the word simply to describe

618
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,120
God is just the name.

619
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,600
Names are crucial.

620
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,800
Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible, but you know this, even nicknaming has rules.

621
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,120
Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up, maybe you still go by that nickname,

622
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,480
maybe introduce yourself as a particular name, maybe you know like, but there's some

623
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
rules that go along with that, you know that there's rules about that.

624
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,680
Now the first rule of nicknaming is, you don't get to choose your own nickname, you don't

625
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,840
get to decide, like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know, now I'm going

626
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:57,680
by MacGyver, kind of rhymes with McGuire, plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know,

627
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,480
like the gum and like a, you know, rubber band and he could like, oh look, let's fly

628
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
away and escape.

629
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,600
He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a, like a scuba tank, he could save

630
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,800
the world, you know, I was like, that's, that's me, I'm going by McGuire, you guys

631
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,400
are coming by McGyver now, woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work, that's not how

632
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,280
it goes, you can't choose your nickname, you don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed

633
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,240
upon you, and the way it always works is sort of a top-down method, either the leader, the

634
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,200
group of a person is like, you're now this, or the group decides, hey we've decided you're

635
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,000
going by this nickname, you'll get to choose it, you can't declare it, it's what we've

636
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,560
all decided because it's a top-down method, it's the way it works, it never gets to be

637
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,800
the other way, it's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of ascribing a nickname

638
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,760
to a person, and there's always, it tends to be, not always, but tends to be a moment

639
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,840
of like kind of mockery that's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of a little bit

640
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,000
funny but it's based in truth, it always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that,

641
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,560
you know, so I can never figure out, even to this day, why my 12-year-old soccer coach

642
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,360
called me lanky, I can't figure out what the truth was in there, I don't really know, that's

643
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,920
weird, anyway, so anyway, where was I going, now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your

644
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,240
own name, right, you guys watch Seinfeld and maybe you saw George try to be called T-Bone

645
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,840
and never really kind of panned out for him, the top-down method is how this works, remember

646
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,000
this, this is going to matter in a second, and there's always an element of sort of truth

647
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,200
and mockery that kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff, now, in Luke chapter 8,

648
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,240
Jesus encounters a man, this man is what we would call demonized, he's possessed by a

649
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,080
demon, and what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs, he doesn't

650
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,440
have a house, he's all by himself, now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late

651
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,760
modern world, we have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

652
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,120
or demon possession, couple of different things, one of the things we tend to think, looking

653
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,320
back into the Bible as we go, look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis,

654
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
anytime anybody had something sort of, some sort of mental illness, they would just naturally

655
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,280
ascribe it to demon, oh, that's a demon, that's what that is, and I just want to say, you

656
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,320
might be right, but I also want to just propose something else, the Bible does talk about

657
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,160
a spiritual dimension of reality that is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on

658
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,680
a regular ongoing basis and sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that

659
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,160
are happening, and I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic,

660
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,200
people who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak,

661
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,160
and yet there is still in the Bible this description of things that where demons, spirit beings

662
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,960
are at work against what God is trying to do, and here's what I just want to say, the

663
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,840
one does not exclude the other, there is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose

664
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:37,120
back in the first century, and there is also demonic activity that's also at work, so I

665
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,040
just want to make sure we're all clear on that, are we okay moving forward with this?

666
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:45,080
Okay, good, here we go, now here's the scene, Luke 8, 26, they sailed to the regions of

667
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,680
the Jeresians which is across the lake from Galilee, so this is in the northern part of

668
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,920
Israel, there's two big lakes, there's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea,

669
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,080
Dead Sea's way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee's much more important because things live there,

670
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,200
and on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other

671
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,360
side, this is where people don't go very often, but when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a

672
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,000
demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a

673
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,360
house, but had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again, this is this person who lives

674
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,960
by himself naked in the tombs, and this man runs up to Jesus, and when he saw Jesus he cried out

675
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,040
and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what's important to keep in mind. When you

676
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,480
see this, and the story's also in Mark chapter 5, you can read this story, and one of the things

677
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,480
that's crucial when you see it is there's always this really difficult distinction between, it's

678
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,440
hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking, who's talking here, is the

679
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,960
demon or is it the guy, what I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of

680
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,720
keep it, it's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me.

681
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,360
Now, when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what do

682
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,880
you want with me Jesus, Son of the Most High God, I beg you don't torture me. So this is such an

683
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:59,040
interesting kind of encounter, some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

684
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,120
is an attempt to gain control over Jesus, which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know

685
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,360
rule number two, it's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this,

686
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,920
this is what's going to be shown in a moment here, but there's this this sort of crying out of

687
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
Jesus's name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him, verse 29, for Jesus had commanded the

688
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,000
impure spirit to come out of the man, this is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence, like the

689
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,480
reason why this guy is saying this is because of this, so Luke is recording what happened, he's

690
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,880
like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever, is because

691
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,560
of this right here, for Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man,

692
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,560
and many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard,

693
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,120
he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places, let's pause here

694
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:49,520
for a second, so often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness,

695
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,800
so often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness, it isn't that the man

696
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,720
was like, oh man, I feel like I got a thing, I got a ghost, it's that the thing itself drove him

697
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:12,480
into the solitary places to be alone, then Jesus asked him, what is your name?

698
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,440
Legion, he replied, because many demons had gone into him, the word Legion to talk about a Roman

699
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,200
Legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers, so the idea of this means that there's

700
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:36,640
a ton of demonic activity in this particular person, what is your name? The question that's

701
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,720
being asked here is who's in charge, things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly

702
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,480
taking control of the moment, and Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to

703
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,760
fly in the face of the whole idea here, the demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus

704
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,560
because of, you know, he's able to like name him, what's being said here is that there is in fact

705
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,960
Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing and takes control of the moment, and then there's this

706
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,840
tragic comic kind of thing that happens next is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets

707
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,440
cast out into a herd of pigs which are nearby apparently, and then the pigs run into a lake

708
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,000
and drown, that's the story, they're like we're possessed, and they drown, that's it, I mean

709
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,200
that was a galloping pig by the way, if those of you guys are wondering that's what galloping pigs

710
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,320
look like, and they run away and they drown, now the question that you have which is a fair question

711
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:38,320
is what does this have to do with anybody's anxiety, let me tell you, one of the things that

712
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,360
happens in anxiety is this, one of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a

713
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,600
fusion, a linking and overlapping between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers

714
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,480
from anxiety or depression and that person themselves, they make it their identity, it's

715
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,360
one of the most tragic things that happens, one of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in

716
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,520
her own anxiety, her own anxiety journey, this is my wife, she said, I realized I had to stop

717
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,680
just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety, who I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm

718
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,600
always anxious, I'm anxious, she finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed,

719
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,120
maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious, this was something that was a problem that

720
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:19,200
needed to be addressed, fusing the two things together, Curtis Chang and his book which I

721
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,000
mentioned before and I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them or

722
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know, no just kidding, but if you

723
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,240
want to borrow it it's fine, but we have a couple, his book's great but here's one of the things he

724
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:35,760
says to this very effect, when we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety

725
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,280
for extended periods, I love the language, we identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts

726
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,600
that our minds fuse with these thoughts, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we

727
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,800
play it over and over and over again, we talked about this last week about ruminating, the more we

728
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,360
rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa,

729
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,840
the more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads, the more we become indistinguishable

730
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,840
from that narrative, such that we cannot abandon those thoughts and this mental fusion can be so

731
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:18,480
complete we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked, in other words when we start

732
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,720
having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads and it starts

733
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:31,760
to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating, you can see where this is going,

734
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:39,040
we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us and find a way to rein

735
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:52,960
it in, so here's what we need to do, name it, name it, we have to call the thing whatever the

736
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,560
thing is we have to call it what it is so that we can separate it from ourselves, here's what Curtis

737
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,400
Chang says once again, when we can name our thoughts we recognize them as distinct from us

738
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:11,120
differentiation, we're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in

739
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:16,080
our minds but they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation,

740
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:23,920
there's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us,

741
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,720
when I named my anxious thoughts he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them,

742
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,160
the more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them,

743
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,200
the more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify, the more I watched those thoughts

744
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,040
with detached observation and not engagement and the more I said, oh I recognize you,

745
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:54,480
the more the anxious thoughts faded away, so let's call it what it is, we've got to name it,

746
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,200
we've got to name it and the question you have which is a fair question is, how do I name it,

747
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,400
I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do

748
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,480
with it and I just want to tell you again we're just going to look at kind of this is the very

749
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,760
beginning stages of stuff but let's just talk about this for a moment, one of the most helpful

750
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,160
ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in

751
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,960
your life, where are things not going smoothly, where's their friction, in other words take a

752
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,280
different way, can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated,

753
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,800
afraid, etc, where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing,

754
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,920
for instance if you're going through Del Taco and you're like they give you the wrong hot sauce

755
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,280
and you're like that's a bummer they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho and they

756
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,480
gave me regular old lame hot sauce and you're like that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response,

757
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,120
if you're like they didn't give me del scorcho I'm burning the place down,

758
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,600
by the way that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho okay but I'm just saying

759
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:00,160
that there's a moment where you're like that my response should be a two but it feels like it's

760
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,800
a 12, this is probably where you're going maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to

761
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,800
figure out what's going on here, there's a pattern where I'm overreacting it should be a two and I'm

762
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,720
giving it a 12 out of 10, something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for

763
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,800
all of us and they're all different kinds of scales, for me confession okay, I have to be very

764
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,680
very careful anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children

765
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,640
because there's a part of me and I've told you guys this before that if you're with us last week

766
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,360
I said the thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been

767
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:43,200
chasing me is this right here being a disappointment and being irrelevant these are the things that

768
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,200
come up with now in a competition anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser not just lose

769
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:56,640
but be a loser it's right into this stuff so I have a level of intensity with my own kids in

770
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,160
competition which is really I have to measure and some things I can't do whether it's like doing

771
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,440
things that's like an activity we do together like surfing it's like my kids are all better

772
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,760
surfers than me by a long shot but I'm like you know I just I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as

773
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,480
they are they're in there like my oldest is 20 he lives like it goes to school right next to the

774
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,360
beach he serves constantly he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes I'm like what's wrong with the

775
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,280
world anyway but he does that he's awesome and my other kids are incredible all the things they do

776
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,800
and I'm like I'm out and it's like I'm making it a competition and I have to win we're playing

777
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,760
cards we're playing horse and how much does it matter if I'm like playing horse with my son how

778
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:41,440
important is it that I win crucial is the answer to that question but it should be a two and it's

779
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,920
a 12 why does it matter I have to be very careful with these things where's their friction name it

780
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,680
you have to find some of the friction is probably one of the most helpful things you can do but

781
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,880
there's another layer to this and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult and it's

782
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,640
nonetheless crucial and by the way I have to apologize in advance is where I give you this

783
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,720
okay I'm gonna show you it in a second it rhymes okay and I always am afraid when it rhymes like

784
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:06,000
oh gosh we just packaged this up in a little neat little thing and there's probably a little

785
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,760
slight little tiny if you look closely a little tm on the top right of the circle around it like

786
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,800
trademark there's nothing I just want to make sure I want you to make sure you remember it

787
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,520
but for those of you guys that have a high like really sensitive cheese meter this is gonna set

788
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,680
you off okay it's very cheesy but it's really crucial okay so bear with me okay you guys you

789
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,080
guys ready for I think you can handle this okay so not only are we finding the friction where is

790
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,960
there this ongoing sort of pattern where I'm overreacting to certain things but bear with me

791
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:40,400
you probably what is more crucial than that is to find the fiction behind the friction I do not

792
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:52,640
appreciate that sir because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie behind every anxiety

793
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:59,360
that we feel is a near perfect lie like wow that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about

794
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,960
a particular thing and the thing that people that you may not be you but people that are around you

795
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,440
that might suffer from anxiety they're believing a particular lie that's being rehearsed over and

796
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,000
over again in their head and it's nearly perfect and the question we have to ask which is a very

797
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,760
courageous question which may require actual therapy you might have to go to a person who

798
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,800
can help you uncover this stuff but the point is there is 99 percent I'm gonna go 100 percent okay

799
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,040
there's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety there is a perfect lie behind

800
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,280
it and to ask the question where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial

801
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,480
behind the anxiety is a particular lie I showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down

802
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,240
and it's a lie let me give you some things to think about if you if you're having trouble kind of

803
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,000
identifying it this is not going to answer every question but maybe some of these you might connect

804
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,760
with okay here if blank happens it means I've lost control and when I lose control the whole world

805
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,640
goes it just whatever I just I have to be in control and if something happens it means I've

806
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,560
lost control it could be any number of things for you in can be small and it can be big it can be I

807
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,240
I'm late for dropping my kids off for school I'm late for picking up it could be I'm late for school

808
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,240
it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in it could be if I don't

809
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,720
connect with these people if I mess up my own if I don't get on Instagram enough times I don't see

810
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:23,600
these things it means I've lost control some of you might have this scenario there won't there

811
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,240
won't be enough I know what will happen there's just not going to be enough blank filling whatever

812
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,560
you want there money attention affection love I know that if I say yes to this now then there

813
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:39,520
won't be enough later or if this person says yes to this in my life there's only a certain there's

814
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:43,360
like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need and if they take a slice it's going to be

815
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:47,680
one less thing available for me or for anybody else or just won't be enough of whatever it is

816
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,720
you can maybe that's you some of you have this if I can't blank well whatever it is I'll be alone

817
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,760
if I can't do well as a student if I don't perform well at my job if I'm not a good friend if I

818
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,400
don't appear wonder if I don't do beauty well if I don't do personal health and fitness well

819
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,040
if I don't do living the California life well then I'll be all alone and people won't want me

820
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,320
that may be you some people have this one just connects with a lot of people

821
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,040
things are going so great but now what like I know everything's awesome but that only means

822
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,920
there's an impending doom right around the corner I feel like things are going great my

823
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,720
friendships are great maybe you're single and you got all your crew of friends you're like we're

824
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,800
getting along great and we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing

825
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,760
it's all gonna go it's something's gonna happen immediately maybe you're a person who's got a

826
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,440
mom group and you're all hanging out things are incredible you've got your kids and your marriages

827
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,200
are incredible and you're like it's just a it's a matter of time for everything goes away there's

828
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,240
going to be a disease there's going to be a volcano there's going to be something that

829
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,640
swallows us up we're all going to die I just know it there'll be a puddle on the way to church I mean

830
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:00,880
you know you never know a lot of people have this things are going great but they can't forever

831
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,040
just waiting for the thing the house of cards to fall that's an anxiety some people have this

832
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,960
that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do however I try to communicate

833
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,600
who I am I'll never be fully understood which is a matter of being not loved and being alone once

834
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,960
again I just cannot be an understood person and this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious

835
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:27,360
state some people have this what if we what if I or we never get through blank we're a tough

836
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,200
patch in our marriage I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life I want to meet the

837
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,720
I want to meet Mr. Right I want to meet Mrs. Right I want to be I want to be I want to be around

838
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,480
these bad what if I I but like I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it and

839
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,840
what if I don't get through what if we never get through it what if the tough spot of my marriage

840
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,640
or the disease or the illness I never get through it what if that never happens what I'm just preparing

841
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,760
myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel so what if I never

842
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:57,000
get through it. All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the

843
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:02,160
things that we're worried about and they generate for us a kind of anxiety about

844
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,720
this stuff and for some of you it may not be you like I said you may not be the

845
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,280
person who's got anxiety you may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all

846
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,480
that kind of stuff but you probably live with people and you're like why are they

847
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,560
reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2 because there's probably a fiction

848
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:21,560
behind it that's generating that sort of thing. Now what do we do with that? Now

849
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:26,640
this is really important depending this what we do with that depends really

850
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,760
crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus. You with me? Some of

851
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,760
you are like look I'm okay with Jesus I came because you're talking about anxiety

852
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,120
there's some cool stuff but I just want to tell you this is there's a dimension

853
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,160
that we're gonna talk about here which is so important to like understanding

854
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,720
what it is to walk with Jesus because there's a spiritual dimension to faith

855
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,160
it is not just practical help for all these kinds of things you go lots of

856
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,360
places to get that this is and we're okay with that by the way we're church

857
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,120
we're kind of okay with Jesus but I want to try to give you a sense of what we

858
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,320
talk about next that is gonna push this a little further and I think it's

859
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,000
probably what for some of you may be like an invitation to step into something

860
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you've not yet considered but here's what I want to do remember when you look

861
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,360
back at this story Jesus with this demonized person this man who's naked

862
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,560
in the tombs it's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon Jesus doesn't need the

863
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,840
name to be able to take control which is really important to keep in mind but

864
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,920
Jesus extracts the name of the demon the demon says his own name Legion the guy

865
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,240
doesn't do it the demons one who drove him into isolation he's the demon he's

866
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,800
the naked demon guy living in the tombs doesn't live at home anymore and even the

867
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,880
guy couldn't name the thing Jesus has to draw it out of this person and maybe for

868
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,640
you when it comes to naming some of this stuff you actually need some

869
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,280
supernatural assistance to do it you actually need this is what Jesus really

870
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,960
can do and the inner stuff all this stuff it's hard requires courage and

871
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,800
humility and this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

872
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,680
let's go back to Philippians 4 6 and 7 do not be anxious about anything but in

873
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,640
every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present request to

874
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,760
God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your

875
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,680
hearts and your minds and Christ Jesus what's so crucial to keep in mind is

876
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,320
every anxious person loves the second part of that the peace of God which

877
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,400
transcends understanding we all want that everybody even if you're not an

878
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,400
anxious person like that sounds great the peace of God which is beyond even my

879
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,840
understanding I want that but what I want to do today is this during everything

880
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:26,040
in mind I want to focus on this part of that verse prayer and petition when most

881
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:29,960
of us think about prayer we think about petition which is asking for a

882
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,860
particular thing petition means I'm asking for particularly you know it's

883
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,720
like it's the language of petitions in the First Amendment that we write to

884
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,320
petition the government is part of what's in there like that's actually

885
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,480
gets to ask for a particular thing to make something to make a request a formal

886
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,520
request of a thing which is part of what's being described here in fact even

887
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,240
it says make your request known to God but there's also something else there it

888
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,120
says prayer and petition which they're under the same umbrella but there's

889
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,440
something different about the two things which is worth thinking about because

890
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,480
for a lot of us all we think about is prayers while I ask God for stuff and

891
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:05,600
then hope he delivers and I'm ready for a couple different answers you know like

892
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,160
maybe you heard that growing up it's like yes you can have what you want no

893
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,960
you can't or you just have to wait around a little while it's like that's

894
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,200
all we know about prayer and I just want to say that there's there's a

895
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,680
beautiful part to that but I just want to kind of expand it a little bit

896
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,840
broader than that because maybe in prayer what we get to do is to seek God to do

897
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,280
something that's beyond asking him for stuff or to just simply solve a thing

898
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,880
one of the things we get to do in prayer is actually to ask God to reveal

899
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:36,680
something to us about us which means we're not asking we're just listening

900
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,000
in effect here's what the psalmist writes in Psalm 139 these famous words

901
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
search me God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if

902
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,640
there is any offensive some translations have the word hurtful way in me and lead

903
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:59,480
me in the way everlasting like there is some way through the anxiety to be led

904
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:03,880
in an everlasting and eternal kind of life not just forever like someday far

905
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,640
away but right now in the present to say it differently again another rhyming

906
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,840
thing please buckle your seatbelt I apologize but you need this okay stay

907
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:17,720
with me all healing whether it's like a medical like you broke your foot you

908
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:22,360
got an ear infection you got a heart condition all healing begins with

909
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:28,520
revealing we have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing

910
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,960
so that it can be addressed this is part of the naming process right and

911
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,320
it's scary because we have to see it for what it is so here's what I'm gonna do

912
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:41,440
I'm gonna give you a prayer it is a two-word prayer you can practice it

913
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,600
whenever you want however you want I'm gonna give you a rundown on how to do

914
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,440
it right now in a second but it's a two-word prayer that requires some

915
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,280
courage and it's different for a lot of you that maybe you haven't yet understood

916
00:58:51,280 --> 00:59:03,280
what prayer is and here's what it looks like you ready search me search me there's

917
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,960
something that needs to be revealed to me that I can't find on my own to be

918
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,280
named so that I can differentiate it from myself and I need God to reveal it

919
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,160
in me with tenderness with care not with shame not with condemnation but with

920
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:27,240
love that gets drawn out so that in mind let's pray I'm gonna give you a moment

921
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:34,760
just as your eyes are closed to sit in the stillness of this if there is a

922
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,400
contrast between the loudness and the voices of anxiety it must be stillness

923
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:53,520
and silence Jesus search me

924
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:32,800
search me Jesus that I might find where there's friction

925
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:55,120
search me Jesus to uncover the lie the fiction that's undergirding that friction

926
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:20,120
when I can't name them what you name them my anxious thoughts Jesus

927
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:36,760
will you lead me in the way ever-lasting

928
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:53,440
Father would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you

929
01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:01,720
in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives would you hear

930
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:07,840
your name the name that rescues that breaks through into the darkness Jesus

931
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:16,120
Jesus it is in your name that we pray Jesus amen

932
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:40,120
please bring it all to be the storm surrounding me

933
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:53,600
let it break and your name still call us it is still the rage you need is still

934
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,480
every way

935
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:07,080
and your name Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

936
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:20,480
Jesus Jesus silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

937
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:27,480
Jesus Jesus

938
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:38,480
we call these bones to live and call these lungs to sing once again

939
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:48,480
I will praise Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

940
01:03:48,480 --> 01:04:02,480
Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

941
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:27,480
Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus

942
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:43,480
you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus you make the darkness

943
01:04:43,480 --> 01:05:04,480
true Jesus Jesus you silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus

944
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:12,480
would you do this would you just stand together one of the things that you probably heard me say

945
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,480
this before if you've been around which is when we're singing we're setting our collective

946
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:21,480
prayer to music that's all we're doing and there's some real power in the prayer of people

947
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:25,480
being uttered at the same time in the same place there's something that happens in that

948
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,480
and I don't know how to explain it I just know that it does and so all I want us to do

949
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:36,480
is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices to sing that one more time together
