1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ. Come on, put those hands.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's sing.

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you believe, won't you put them together?

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
By His blood, I have been severed.

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I believe in resurrection.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let's sing all praise.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hallelujah, yes I do.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hallelujah, I believe in Him.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I believe in the hope of heaven.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He's preparing the place for me.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Far beyond my heart's imagine.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here's a bird and night I see.

16
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I believe that He's going.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
His return is to blame, it's bright.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Light the altar, keep it burning.

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
See the light, the rose of holy light, yeah.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
All praise to the Father.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All praise to Christ the Son.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All praise to the Holy Spirit.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Our God has overblown.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe, yeah.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I believe in You, Lord, and I trust You.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I believe in You, though I'll never be ashamed.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How could I ever walk away?

30
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Will the Word have saved my life?

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, I'll never.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of the gospel of Jesus.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How could I ever walk away?

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
From the Word who saves my life?

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No, I'll never.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How could I ever walk away?

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
From the Word who saves my life?

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, I'll never.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
All praise to the Father.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
All praise to Christ the Son.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
All praise to the Holy Spirit.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Our God has overblown.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I believe in you.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How can you believe in Jesus today?

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Won't you give him some praise?

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We serve a God that is more than able.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
abundantly, how baffled we can ask for things.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Continue on our worship and sing unto the Lord.

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We trust you to depend on the Lord.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The Son.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When did I start to forgive?

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
All of the great things you did.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And when did I throw away my faith for Him?

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In the gospel of love?

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And how did I start to believe?

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You were to fish and fall.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And why do I talk my sick?

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How can I forgive you?

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How can you believe in God?

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are more than able.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are more than able.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Stay it again.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are more than able.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, hear the people today,

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
waiting loud.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You are more than able.

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So who art to deny what the Lord can do?

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

78
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
More than able to rely, to deny what the Lord can do

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can't you imagine?

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And all of the faith in the room, what the Lord can do

82
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What the Lord can do

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, it's gonna happen

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Just like the way we make it through

85
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's gonna load

86
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's gonna load

87
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can't you imagine?

88
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Can't you imagine?

89
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
With all of the faith in the room

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What the Lord can do

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What the Lord can do

92
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it's gonna happen

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Just like the way we make it through

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's gonna load

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's gonna load

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Anything is possible

97
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
We declare it today

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Anything is possible

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Anything is possible

100
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Anything is possible

102
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Anything is possible

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They believe in you

104
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Anything is possible

105
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

108
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, it's easy for you

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I believe in you

110
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
See, you are more than people

111
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why don't you close your eyes and sing that

112
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a place of faith to sing

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So you are more than people

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are more than people

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We trust you are

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You are more than people

117
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes, Jesus

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What a God we serve

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We're gonna sing a new song

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's called You Keep Hope Alive

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's very easy

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I'm gonna teach you first

124
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it's all proclaiming the hope that is in Jesus

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because we have hope in Him

126
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hope to live for tomorrow

127
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's stand in this world

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's sing this

129
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sing

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Day makes me darkest

131
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But your light is greater

132
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You will light our way

133
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
God, you will light our way

134
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And with evil it's rising

135
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You're rising higher

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
With power to save

137
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
With power to save

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm gonna teach you

139
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You keep hope alive

140
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You keep hope alive

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
From the beginning to when

142
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your word never fails

143
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You keep hope alive

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because you are alive

145
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Jesus, you are alive

146
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Death had a strong hope

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And your light is stronger

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're always strong

149
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Liberator rose up from the red

150
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Anybody believe it today

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That the evil is rising

152
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You're rising higher

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
With power to save

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
With power to save

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Come on, you got that

156
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Come on, let's show it all together

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You keep hope alive

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You keep hope alive

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
From the beginning to when

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Your word never fails

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You keep hope alive

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Because you are alive

163
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Jesus, you are alive

164
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
With power to save

165
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Death had a strong hope

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And your light is stronger

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You keep hope alive

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Because you're living hope

169
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Because you're breathing this hope

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
In the brave hope

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In the silent hope

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
For this moment alone

173
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Once you're rising, there is hope

174
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Give the morning hope

175
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
In the evening this hope

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because you're living hope

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Because you're breathing this hope

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In the brave hope

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
In the silent hope

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
For this moment alone

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
For tomorrow

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You keep hope alive

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You keep hope alive

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
From the beginning to when

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Your word never fails

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You keep hope alive

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Because you are alive

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Jesus, you are still alive

189
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You keep hope alive

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You keep hope alive

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
From the beginning to when

192
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Your word never fails

193
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You keep hope alive

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Because you are alive

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Jesus, you are alive

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You keep hope alive

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You keep hope alive

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
From the beginning to when

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Your word never fails

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You keep hope alive

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because you are alive

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Jesus, you are alive

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're alive

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You are alive

205
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't you rest in it

206
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't have to worry about a thing

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Because you're alive

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You keep hope alive

209
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You keep my hope alive

210
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
In the middle of the storm

211
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're standing right there with me

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
In the middle of the fog

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You keep hope alive

214
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you, Lord

215
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If my grandma was here and she wouldn't sing it like this

216
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
She would say, because she lives

217
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I can face tomorrow

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Because Jesus lives

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
All of my fears, they're gone

220
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because I know

221
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I know, I know

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He holds you in His future

223
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
In life

224
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's worth living just

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Because Jesus lives

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's an old song, old song

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm 33, but I got an old soul

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I love those songs, you know

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Can I say one more time, just receive it

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Receive it, let it encourage your spirit

231
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Back in the black church, we just used to sing songs

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When people get excited, because it was the truth

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Because He lives

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Someone needs to hear that

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I can face tomorrow

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because Jesus lives

237
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
All of my fears, they are gone

238
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They are gone

239
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Because I know

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know, I know

241
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He holds my future in

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Life isn't worth

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't have to give up

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's worth living just

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Because you are my Savior

246
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He lives

247
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you know He lives, that's right

248
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Give the Lord some praise

249
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
My life is worth living because He lives

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because Jesus lives

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm gonna leave that alone before I start running

252
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Welcome to Harbor Point, how y'all doing?

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I know y'all wondering again

255
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
This man is shouting at me again

256
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Y'all black dude, you gotta get off the stage

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Y'all, hey, I love you too

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I love you too

259
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today

260
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is an amazing church, so glad

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm singing with my sister Brittany

262
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who is Kobe's wife

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And she's singing for the first time

264
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
In what, four or five years?

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Jesus

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back

267
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
We got the same alma mater in Ohio

268
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And when I got my first job out of college

269
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was living with them in Houston, Texas

270
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And they let me live there like a little brother

271
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For free, just trying to find my way

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Somehow, I got myself out to California

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Because of Kobe

274
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And it's cool, like in this moment

275
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I've been singing here and there, here and now

276
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
We're getting to lead and love God together

277
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Again, so I'm so grateful for both of you

278
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Love you, Kobe, don't y'all love Kobe?

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I ain't gonna say nothing smart this time

280
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Alright, well, I love you too

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And why don't you tell some people around you

282
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I love you, and then you may have a seat

283
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Okay

284
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Hey everyone, thanks for joining us today

285
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We're so glad you're here

286
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
At Harbor Point, giving is more than just a financial transaction

287
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's part of our worship

288
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a tangible expression of our devotion and gratitude to God

289
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Demonstrating that our hearts are centered on Him

290
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Each week, we bring our offerings as an expression of our commitment

291
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
To God's work in and through His Church

292
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Whether this is your first time giving

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Or you're continuing your giving

294
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Please take a look at the various ways you can contribute

295
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Thank you for your generosity

296
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We're thrilled to continue our summer series

297
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
At the Movies

298
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This year, you can enjoy At the Movies at two locations

299
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The Regency Theatre in San Juan on Sundays at 10 a.m.

300
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And at Harbor Point for our regular weekend services

301
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And don't forget Encore

302
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Bringing our At the Movies experience to Regency Theatre

303
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
On Thursday nights at 6.30 p.m.

304
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's a fantastic opportunity to invite your friends, neighbors, and coworkers

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you've been a part of Harbor Point for a while

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You've heard us say that every good thing that we do is done through great volunteers

307
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And that's you

308
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When I think of some of the amazing volunteers

309
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think of Travis and Tina

310
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Who served so faithfully on our worship team for Harbor Point's VBS

311
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We're so grateful for how they gave their time and talents

312
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
To pour into the next generation

313
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So, if you're already serving at Harbor Point

314
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We would love to say thank you

315
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Or if you're curious about what it might look like to step into serving

316
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We want to invite you to our volunteer rally and lunch

317
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000

Men of Harbor Point Man Camp 2024 is just a few weeks away

321
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This transformative retreat will offer a unique opportunity to step away

322
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
From the daily life and connect with God and other men in our community

323
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You'll experience powerful worship, inspiring messages, and build lasting friendships

324
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Man Camp will take place at Forest Home from August 23rd to 25th

325
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
As summer comes to a close

326
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Student ministries will be holding their end of summer celebrations

327
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Over the next couple weeks

328
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
High school will be celebrating with a beach bonfire at Dohini on Thursday, August 15th

329

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Or the Regency Theater

334
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But we thank you so much for joining us online today for our series on anxiety called

335
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
A Back of Angry Beasts

336
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Alright, hey everybody, how's it going?

337
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yeah, you guys chose a 10 o'clock service, you love traffic, you feel like it's raining

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We can get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately

340
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Like, how am I gonna put to test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus

341
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But to find a parking lot that's miserable and work my way out of it

342
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And you did it, you found it, way to go

343
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Glad you guys made it, those of you guys are in the tent, glad you guys made it

344
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well

345
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It is so good to be with you guys and for those of you guys who are online

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Of course, we say this every single week

347
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to be together

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Because the people of our church are amazing, and really you guys are

349
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm really grateful to be with you guys, so fun

350
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
If you're, and I know you had to drive today through a puddle

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car

352
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And you made it, it's incredible, so great stuff happening, let's get right to it

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We have a lot to cover as we talk about this

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff and I just want to make sure we're clear

355
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We do not have all the answers, this is not a church where we have everything figured out

356
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Here's what we know, we're looking at Jesus, we believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus

357
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And that requires everybody to help us along the way

358
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Everybody's got a next step in that, so whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus

359
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take

360
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all together

361
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Who are work in progress kind of people doing that stuff

362
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So, however that is, grateful that you're here, let's get right to it

363
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I want to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention as you watch this commercial

364
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay, but, I recognize it, it's fine

366
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Check this out, okay, here we go

368
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Mary Clary thinks her zipper bags are the best, and will never switch to Gladlock zipper bags

369
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's right, never

370
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here, with either your bag filled with angry bees

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees

372
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
See that green color chain seal there, Mayor? That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed

373
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Your bag doesn't have a green seal

374
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You know, change is good, I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Just kidding, Mayor

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
When it really counts, don't get mad, get Gladlock zipper bags

377
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay, some of you remember this commercial

378
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Now, what I want to, obviously it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over-analyzing it and taking it way too seriously

379
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay, that's the gift I bring

380
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But, let's look at this for a moment

381
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice

382
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which makes the green thing

383
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial

384
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag

385
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Would you rather have hold the angry bees that we're going to give you

386
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed to do this

387
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea

388
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That these people who are making this scenario happen, not only have they got bees to give a person to hold

389
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth

390
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is

391
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It's like an elevator that doesn't go anywhere, that's all that it is

392
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's the same thing, you're talking on a phone but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there

393
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which they're agreeing to do

394
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

395
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away, I don't want to do any of this

396
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't care what bag you use, I'm not doing this, this whole thing is stupid

397
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her in this thing

398
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that

399
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The question is, and why are people saying yes to this

400
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And the question, over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously

401
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The question is, well who's in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea?

402
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person

403
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth, the whole thing is bizarre and absurd

404
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
And who's in charge here

405
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety

406
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Who's in charge here?

407
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We're in week two of a series called The Bag of Angry Bees and it's a series on anxiety

408
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees

409
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But I want to catch us up a little bit, if you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing fields

410
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
As we talk about this idea of anxiety

411
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
One of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety

412
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Fear is the response to something that has happened

413
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Like bear, person with a knife coming after us, oh my gosh that's fear

414
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Anxiety is, what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?

415
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's anxiety, are you with me? One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing

416
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And we said generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing that's happening

417
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern

418
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level

419
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level, are you with me?

420
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something in common

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Every single anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty

422
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain

423
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

424
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
All of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety

425
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current statistics on this

426
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have someone in your house perhaps

427
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Or you yourself as someone who has anxiety

428
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you grew up

429
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What kind of healthy environment you might have encountered

430
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety

431
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The best solution is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it

432
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it

433
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff

434
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Compensate by being high functioning

435
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it

436
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Because you shouldn't have to deal with it, just snap out of it

437
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told us

438
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
We were told, here's what you should do

439
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you

440
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
And then by comparison, you won't care anymore

441
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people

442
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either of the anxieties

443
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
In either case

444
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like

445
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
You know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower

446
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Who maybe they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know

447
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression

448
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you

449
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't be anxious about anything, thank you so much

450
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And they're like, well, don't be anxious

451
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God

452
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that

453
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I guess I'm not supposed to have this, because the solution to having anxieties apparently just don't

454
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal with it as a shame thing

455
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Because I'm not supposed to have it, and so it never really gets dealt with at all

456
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level

457
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question

458
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Who's in charge?

459
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in charge?

460
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way

461
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
My feelings or my thoughts are in charge, I'm not in charge, not me, I'm not in charge

462
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm freaking out here

463
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
And this is where it starts, this is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue

464
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
In other words, probably another way to say it is this

465
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Anxiety has a double effect

466
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety

467
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
To say it this way, I'm freaking out about freaking out

468
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And this is why people get stuck in it

469
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough

470
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety

471
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Like, what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral

472
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And you maybe have this experience, or do you know people who do

473
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And here's what I want to do today

474
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I want to give us one tool

475
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
It's not the answer to everything, it doesn't solve all the anxiety

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool

477
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well

478
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It's just gonna, and just again, to make sure we reiterate

479
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm not an expert

480
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Someone told you were doing a series on anxiety

481
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure about Jesus

482
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But I'll come here that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on this

483
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm not an expert, I'm not a therapist, this is not my degree

484
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm a fellow traveler in this

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I do a little bit of research on some stuff

486
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing

487
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys

488
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week

490
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
But I also want to tell you this, fair warning

491
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The way we're gonna get to this one tool is a very windy road

492
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes

493
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't appreciate the laughter

494
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
It's fine, it's fine

495
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
But you're gonna be like, what in the world are we doing?

496
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And then I promise I will bring it back home

497
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
But you're gonna wonder for a little bit

498
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Because I'm gonna start in a place you may not expect

499
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And then we're gonna get there

500
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I'm gonna start in ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

501
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Because that's where you thought I was gonna go

502
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Here's what we're gonna do, I'm totally serious

503
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

504
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Here's what happens, it happens in six phases

505
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
This is the first of the phases, it starts like this

506
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's the boundary making of a particular thing

507
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Here's where things are, here's where things are

508
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
This separates the sacred space from the not sacred space

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Boundary making

510
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filming

511
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There's some filling of things and some further separation of things

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Which are separated from other spaces

514
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East

515
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And the sixth phase of the Temple construction

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Whatever it is, whatever god that's being worshipped there

517
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You typically, it's placed within there on the sixth phase

518
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation

519
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Sort of the creation of a temple

520
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple

521
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
To give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple

522
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Now, there are six days, there's a seven day creation

523
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But there's a six day creation narrative in the Bible

524
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation

525
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So god created mankind in his own image

526
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
And the image of god, he created them male and female

527
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
He created them, this is the sixth day of creation

528
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Now, let me pause right here for a second

529
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
What's being said by this, many scholars agree

530
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible

531
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that yet

532
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
That's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this

533
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god's temple

534
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
The entire thing, no temple could contain him

535
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So the whole cosmos is his temple

536
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day

537
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
It's a person, people become the representation of this god

538
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In his temple, the whole cosmos

539
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28

540
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number

541
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And fill the earth and subdue it some translations

542
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And have dominion over it

543
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky

544
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And over every living creature that moves on the ground

545
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
So this, the people aren't just simply decoration

546
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
There's more there, they're blessed and they're told to multiply and have dominion

547
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And the answer to the question, who's in charge of all of the created stuff?

548
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The answer is, people are

549
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation

550
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to

551
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Is god himself, other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things

552
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It's gift to Genesis chapter 2, where it gets a little bit more specific about some of this stuff

553
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground

554
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
All the wild animals and all the birds of the sky

555
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them

556
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name

557
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals

558
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man

559
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
This created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos

560
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Which now has this responsibility to name everything

561
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Again, this might be a challenge for some of you

562
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Like I'm not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what's happening here

563
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Because here's what's happening in naming

564
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible

565
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this

566
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
The first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing

567
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
So when someone names a thing, it says this is a that and I'm not that

568
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That's not me, over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is from me

569
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
That's separate from me

570
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me

571
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Does that make sense, this is differentiation, you're different than me

572
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
That's what's being said, when we name a thing

573
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Secondly what happens in naming is sort of an authority over

574
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing

575
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not me

576
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
But it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named

577
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible

578
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
The Old Testament, the Old Covenant

579
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting

580
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Kind of conversation about names

581
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Not least of which is the name of God

582
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Which is kind of if you read Moses' interaction with God

583
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
In the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before

584
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
But one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool

585
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What do I tell people your name is as if to say

586
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed

587
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
It's so unbelievably important and sacred

588
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
In fact, to this day, you will find

589
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God

590
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
They'll refer to God as this word, Hashem

591
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Who in that word simply means the name

592
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Like we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God

593
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Because it's so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment

594
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
So the word simply to describe God is just the name

595
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Names are crucial

596
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible

597
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But you know this, even nicknaming has rules

598
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up

599
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Maybe you still go by that nickname

600
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Maybe introduce yourself as a particular name

601
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Maybe, you know, like, but there's some rules that go along with that

602
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
You know that there's rules about that

603
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Now the first rule of nicknaming is

604
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You don't get to choose your own nickname

605
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You don't get to decide

606
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know

607
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Now I'm going by MacGyver

608
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Kind of rhymes with McGuire

609
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum

610
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And like a, you know, rubber band

611
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
And he could like, oh look, let's fly away and escape

612
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a

613
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Like a scuba tank, he could save the world

614
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
You know, I'm going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now

615
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work

616
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
That's not how it goes, you can't choose your nickname

617
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
You don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you

618
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
And the way it always works is sort of a top-down method

619
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Either the leader, the group of a person is like

620
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
You're now this, or the group decides

621
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hey, we've decided you're going by this nickname

622
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You'll get to choose it, you can't declare it

623
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's what we've all decided because it's a top-down method

624
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's the way it's worked, it never gets to be the other way

625
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
It's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of

626
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Ascribing a nickname to a person

627
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And there's always, it tends to be, not always

628
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
But tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery

629
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
That's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of

630
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
A little bit funny, but it's based in truth

631
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that

632
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
You know, so I can never figure out, even to this day

633
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky

634
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I can't figure out what the truth was

635
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
In there, I don't really know, that's weird

636
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Anyway, so anyway, where was I going?

637
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your own name

638
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Right, you guys watch Seinfeld and you know, maybe you saw

639
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him

640
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The top-down method is how this works

641
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Remember this, this is going to matter in a second

642
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
And there's always an element of sort of truth and mockery

643
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff

644
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man

645
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
This man is what we would call demonized

646
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He's possessed by a demon

647
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs

648
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
He doesn't have a house, he's all by himself

649
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world

650
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
We have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

651
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Or, you know, demon possession

652
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
A couple of different things

653
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
One of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go

654
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis

655
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Anytime anybody had something, sort of some sort of mental illness

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
They would just naturally ascribe it to demon

657
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
That's a lot of demon, that's what that is

658
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I just want to say, you might be right

659
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
But I also want to just propose something else

660
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
The Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality

661
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular, ongoing basis

662
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that are happening

663
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic

664
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
People who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak

665
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And yet there is still in the Bible this description of things

666
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do

667
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And here's what I just want to say

668
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The one does not exclude the other

669
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
There is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose back in the first century

670
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And there is also demonic activity that's also at work

671
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
So I just want to make sure we're all clear on that

672
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Are we okay moving forward with this?

673
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Okay, good, here we go

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Now, here's the scene, Luke 8, 26

675
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
They sailed to the regions of the Jeresians, which is across the lake from Galilee

676
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
This is in the northern part of Israel, there's two big lakes

677
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea

678
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
The Dead Sea is way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee is much more important

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Because things live there

680
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other side

681
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
This is where people don't go very often

682
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
But when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town

683
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house

684
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again

685
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
This is this person who lives by himself, naked in the tombs

686
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And this man runs up to Jesus

687
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice

688
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
What's important to keep in mind

689
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
When you see this, and the story is also in Mark 5

690
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You can read this story, and one of the things that's crucial when you see it

691
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Is there's always this really difficult distinction between

692
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking

693
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Who's talking here? Is the demon or is it the guy?

694
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
What I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of keep it

695
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me

696
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Now, when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice

697
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?

698
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I beg you, don't torture me

699
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
So this is such an interesting kind of encounter

700
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

701
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Is an attempt to gain control over Jesus

702
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know rule number two

703
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this

704
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
This is what's going to be shown in a moment here

705
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
But there's this sort of crying out of Jesus' name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him

706
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Verse 29

707
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

708
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
This is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence

709
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this

710
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So Luke is recording what happened

711
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
He's like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever

712
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Is because of this right here

713
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

714
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard

715
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
He had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places

716
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Let's pause here for a second

717
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness

718
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
So often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness

719
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
It isn't that the man was like, oh man I feel like I got a thing

720
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I got a ghost

721
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone

722
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Then Jesus asked him

723
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:17,000
What is your name?

724
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him

725
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The word legion to talk about a Roman legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers

726
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So the idea of this means that there's a ton of demonic activity in this particular person

727
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
What is your name?

728
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The question that's being asked here is who's in charge

729
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of the moment

730
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face of the whole idea here

731
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know, he's able to like name him

732
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What's being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing

733
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And takes control of the moment

734
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
And then there's this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next

735
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs

736
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Which are nearby apparently

737
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And then the pigs run into a lake and drown

738
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
That's the story, they're like, we're possessed!

739
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And they drown, that's it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way

740
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
If you guys are wondering, that's what galloping pigs look like

741
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And they run away and they drown

742
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Now, the question that you have, which is a fair question is

743
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What does this have to do with anybody's anxiety?

744
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this

745
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
One of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a linking and overlapping

746
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression

747
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And that person themselves, they make it their identity

748
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
It's one of the most tragic things that happens

749
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
One of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety journey

750
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
This is my wife, she said

751
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety

752
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm always anxious, I'm anxious

753
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
She finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed

754
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious

755
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
This was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed

756
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Fusing the two things together

757
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Curtis Chang in his book, which I mentioned before

758
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them

759
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know

760
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
No, just kidding, but if you want to borrow it, it's fine

761
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
But we have a couple, his book's great, but here's one of the things he says to this very effect

762
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
When we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended periods

763
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I love the language

764
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
We identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these thoughts

765
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and over

766
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
We talked about this last week, about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative

767
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
The more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa

768
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
The more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads

769
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The more we become indistinguishable from that narrative

770
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Such that we cannot abandon those thoughts

771
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
And this mental fusion can be so complete, we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked

772
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
In other words, when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads

773
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating

774
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us

775
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And find a way to rein it in

776
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So here's what we need to do

777
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Name it

778
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Name it

779
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,000
We have to call the thing, whatever the thing is, we have to call it what it is

780
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So that we can separate it from ourselves

781
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Here's what Curtis Chang says once again

782
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
When we can name our thoughts, we recognize them as distinct from us

783
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Differentiation

784
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,000
We're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in our minds

785
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
But they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation

786
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:26,000
There's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us

787
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
When I named my anxious thoughts, he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them

788
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them

789
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
The more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify

790
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
The more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement

791
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And the more I said, oh, I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded away

792
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So let's call it what it is, we've got to name it

793
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Got to name it

794
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
And the question you have, which is a fair question, is how do I name it?

795
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do with it?

796
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And I just want to tell you, again, we're just going to look at kind of, this is the very beginning stages of stuff

797
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But let's just talk about this for a moment

798
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
One of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in your life

799
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Where are things not going smoothly? Where's their friction?

800
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
In other words, take it a different way

801
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated, afraid, etc.

802
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing?

803
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
For instance, if you're going through Del Taco and you're like, they gave you the wrong hot sauce

804
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
And you're like, that's a bummer, they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho

805
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
And they gave me regular old lame hot sauce

806
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And you're like, that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response

807
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
If you're like, they didn't give me del scorcho, I'm burning the place down

808
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
By the way, that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho

809
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay, but I'm just saying that there's a moment where you're like, my response should be a two, but it feels like it's a twelve

810
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
This is probably where you're going, maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to figure out what's going on here

811
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
There's a pattern where I'm overreacting, it should be a two and I'm giving it a twelve out of ten

812
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for all of us

813
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And they're all different kinds of scales

814
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
For me, confession, okay

815
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have to be very, very careful

816
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children

817
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Because there's a part of me, and I've told you guys this before, if you're with us last week, I said

818
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been chasing me is this right here

819
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Being a disappointment and being irrelevant, these are the things that come up with

820
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Now, in a competition, anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser

821
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Not just lose, but be a loser

822
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
It's right into this stuff

823
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So, I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition

824
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Which is really, I have to measure, and some things I can't do

825
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Whether it's like, doing things that's like an activity we do together, like surfing

826
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's like, my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot

827
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But I'm like, you know, I just, I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as they are

828
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
They're in there, like, my oldest is twenty

829
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
He lives, like, it goes to school right next to the beach

830
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
He surfs constantly, he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes

831
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm like, what is wrong with the world?

832
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Anyway, but he does that, he's awesome

833
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And my other kids are incredible, all the things they do

834
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
And I'm like, I'm out, and it's like, I'm making it a competition and I have to win

835
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
We're playing cards, we're playing horse, and how much does it matter if I'm like

836
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Playing horse with my son, how important is it that I win?

837
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Crucial is the answer to that question

838
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But it should be a two, and it's a twelve, why does it matter?

839
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
I have to be very careful with these things

840
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Where's their friction, name it, you have to find some of the friction

841
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
It's probably one of the most helpful things you can do

842
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But there's another layer to this, and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult

843
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
And it's nonetheless crucial, and by the way, I have to apologize in advance

844
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Before I give you this, I'm going to show you it in a second

845
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
It rhymes, okay?

846
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And I always am afraid when it rhymes, like, oh gosh

847
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We just packaged this up in a little neat little thing

848
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And there's probably a little tiny little, if you look closely

849
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
A little TM on the top right of the circle around it, like trademark

850
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
There's nothing, I just want to make sure, I want you to make sure you remember it

851
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But for those of you guys that have a high, like really sensitive cheese meter

852
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This is going to set you off, okay?

853
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's very cheesy, but it's really crucial, okay?

854
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
So bear with me, okay? You guys ready for that?

855
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I think you can handle this, okay?

856
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So not only are we finding the friction, where is there this ongoing sort of pattern

857
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Where I'm overreacting to certain things

858
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
But bear with me, probably what is more crucial than that

859
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Is to find the fiction behind the friction

860
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I do not appreciate that, sir

861
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie

862
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie

863
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Like, wow, that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular thing

864
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And the thing that people, it may not be you, but people that are around you

865
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
That might suffer from anxiety, they're believing a particular lie

866
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
That's being rehearsed over and over again in their head

867
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And it's nearly perfect, and the question we have to ask

868
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Which is a very courageous question, which may require actual therapy

869
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
You might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff

870
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
But the point is, there is 99%

871
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm going to go 100%, okay?

872
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
There's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety

873
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
There is a perfect lie behind it

874
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And to ask the question, where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial

875
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Behind the anxiety is a particular lie

876
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I've showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down, and it's a lie

877
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Let me give you some things to think about

878
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
If you're having trouble kind of identifying it, this is not going to answer every question

879
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
But maybe some of these you might connect with, okay?

880
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Here

881
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
If blank happens, it means I've lost control

882
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And when I lose control, the whole world goes at just whatever

883
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
I have to be in control

884
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
And if something happens, it means I've lost control

885
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It could be any number of things for you, it can be small, and it can be big

886
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
It can be I'm late for dropping my kids off for school, I'm late for picking my...

887
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It could be I'm late for school, it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in

888
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
It could be if I don't connect with these people, if I mess up my own

889
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
If I don't get on Instagram enough times, or I don't see these things, it means I've lost control

890
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Some of you might have this scenario, there won't be enough

891
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I know what will happen, there's just not going to be enough blank

892
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Filling whatever you want there

893
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Money, attention, affection, love

894
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I know that if I say yes to this now, then there won't be enough later

895
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Or if this person says yes to this in my life

896
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
There's only a certain, there's like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need

897
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And if they take a slice, it's going to be one less thing available for me, or for anybody else

898
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Or just won't be enough of whatever it is

899
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
You can, maybe that's you

900
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Some of you have this, if I can't blank well, whatever it is

901
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I'll be alone

902
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
If I can't do well as a student, if I don't perform well at my job

903
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
If I'm not a good friend, if I don't appear wonderful, if I don't do beauty well

904
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
If I don't do personal health and fitness well

905
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
If I don't do living the California life well, then I'll be all alone and people won't want me

906
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
That may be you

907
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Some people have this one, it just connects with a lot of people

908
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Things are going so great, but now what?

909
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Like I know everything's awesome, but that only means there's an impending doom right around the corner

910
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I feel like things are going great, my friendships are great

911
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Maybe you're single and you've got all your crew of friends, you're like, we're getting along great

912
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,000
And we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing

913
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's all going to go, something's going to happen immediately

914
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Maybe you're a person who's got a mom group and you're all hanging out

915
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
Things are incredible, you've got your kids and your marriages are incredible

916
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And you're like, it's a matter of time before everything goes away

917
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
There's going to be disease, there's going to be a volcano, there's going to be something that swallows us up

918
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
We're all going to die, I just know it

919
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
There'll be a puddle on the way to church, I mean, you never know

920
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
A lot of people have this, things are going great, but they can't forever

921
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Just waiting for the house of cards to fall

922
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
That's an anxiety

923
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Some people have this, that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do

924
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
However, I try to communicate who I am, I'll never be fully understood

925
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Which is a matter of being not loved and being alone

926
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Once again, I just cannot be an understood person

927
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
And this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state

928
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Some people have this

929
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
What if I or we never get through blank?

930
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We're a tough patch in our marriage

931
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life

932
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I want to meet Mr. Wright, I want to meet Mrs. Wright

933
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I want to be around these people

934
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
But I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it

935
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
What if we never get through it?

936
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
What if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness, I never get through it?

937
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
What if that never happens?

938
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I'm just preparing myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel

939
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
So what if I never get through it?

940
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,000
All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we're worried about

941
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
And they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff

942
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And for some of you, it may not be you

943
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Like I said, you may not be the person who's got anxiety

944
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
You may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff

945
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,000
But you probably live with people and you're like, why are they reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2?

946
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Because there's probably a fiction behind it that's generating that sort of thing

947
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Now, what do we do with that?

948
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Now, this is really important

949
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus

950
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Some of you are like, look, I'm okay with Jesus that came because you're talking about anxiety and some cool stuff

951
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
But I just want to tell you, there's a dimension that we're going to talk about here

952
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Which is so important to understanding what it is to walk with Jesus

953
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Because there's a spiritual dimension to faith

954
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
It is not just practical help for all these kinds of things

955
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You go to lots of places to get that

956
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
And we're okay with that, by the way

957
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We're a church, we're kind of okay with Jesus

958
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
But I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next

959
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
That's going to push this a little further

960
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And I think it's probably, for some of you, maybe like an invitation to step into something you've not yet considered

961
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
But here's what I want to do

962
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Remember, when you look back at the story of Jesus with this demonized person

963
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
This man who's naked in the tombs

964
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
It's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon

965
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Jesus doesn't need the name to be able to take control, which is really important to keep in mind

966
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But Jesus extracts the name of the demon, the demon says his own name, Legion

967
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
The guy doesn't do it

968
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
The demon's the one who drove him into isolation

969
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
He's the demon, he's the naked demon guy living in the tombs

970
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Doesn't live at home anymore

971
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And even the guy couldn't name the thing

972
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Jesus has to draw it out of this person

973
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
And maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff

974
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
You actually need some supernatural assistance to do it

975
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You actually need this

976
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
This is what Jesus really can do

977
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And the inner stuff, all this stuff, it's hard

978
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It requires courage and humility

979
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,000
And this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

980
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Let's go back to Philippians 4, 6 and 7

981
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Do not be anxious about anything

982
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving

983
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Present your request to God

984
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And the peace of God which transcends all understanding

985
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus

986
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
What's so crucial to keep in mind is

987
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Every anxious person loves the second part of that

988
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
The peace of God which transcends understanding

989
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
We all want that

990
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Even if you're not an anxious person, you're like, that sounds great

991
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
The peace of God which is beyond even my own understanding

992
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I want that

993
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
But what I want to do today is this

994
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
During everything in mind

995
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
I want to focus on this part of that verse

996
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Prayer and petition

997
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
When most of us think about prayer

998
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
We think about petition

999
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Which is asking for a particular thing

1000
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Petition means I'm asking for a particular thing

1001
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
The language of petition is in the First Amendment

1002
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
The right to petition the government is part of what's in there

1003
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Like that actually gets to ask for a particular thing

1004
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
To make something, to make a request, a formal request of a thing

1005
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Which is part of what's being described here

1006
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
In fact, even it says, make your request known to God

1007
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
But there's also something else there

1008
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It says prayer and petition

1009
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Which they're under the same umbrella

1010
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But there's something different about the two things

1011
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Which is worth thinking about

1012
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Because for a lot of us, all we think about is prayer

1013
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Is while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers

1014
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
And I'm ready for a couple different answers

1015
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You know, like maybe you heard that growing up

1016
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's like, yes, you can have what you want, no you can't

1017
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Or you just have to wait around a little while

1018
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It's like, that's all we know about prayer

1019
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I don't want to say that there's a beautiful part to that

1020
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
But I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that

1021
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Because maybe in prayer what we get to do

1022
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Is to seek God to do something that's beyond asking him for stuff

1023
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Or to just simply solve a thing

1024
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
One of the things we get to do in prayer

1025
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Is actually to ask God to reveal something to us, about us

1026
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Which means we're not asking, we're just listening in effect

1027
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Here's what the Psalmist writes in Psalm 139

1028
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
These famous words, search me God and know my heart

1029
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Test me and know my anxious thoughts

1030
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
See if there is any offensive

1031
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Some translations have the word hurtful way in me

1032
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
And lead me in the way everlasting

1033
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Like there is some way through the anxiety

1034
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
To be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life

1035
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Not just forever, like someday far away

1036
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But right now in the present

1037
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
To say it differently, again, another rhyming thing

1038
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Please buckle your seatbelt, I apologize

1039
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Please read this, okay, stay with me

1040
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
All healing, whether it's like a medical

1041
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Like you broke your foot, you got an ear infection

1042
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You got a heart condition, all healing begins with revealing

1043
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
We have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing

1044
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
So that it can be addressed

1045
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
This is part of the naming process, right

1046
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And it's scary because we have to see it for what it is

1047
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to give you a prayer

1048
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
It is a two-word prayer, you can practice it whenever you want

1049
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
However you want, I'm going to give you a rundown

1050
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
On how to do it right now in a second

1051
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But it's a two-word prayer that requires some courage

1052
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And it's different for a lot of you than maybe you haven't yet understood what prayer is

1053
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
And here's what it looks like, you ready?

1054
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Search me

1055
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Search me

1056
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
There's something that needs to be revealed to me

1057
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
That I can't find on my own to be named

1058
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So that I can differentiate it from myself

1059
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And I need God to reveal it in me

1060
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,000
With tenderness, with care, not with shame

1061
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Not with condemnation, but with love

1062
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
That gets drawn out

1063
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
So, that in mind

1064
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Let's pray

1065
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'm going to give you a moment, just as your eyes are closed

1066
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
To sit in the stillness of this

1067
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
If there is a contrast between the loudness

1068
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
And the voices of anxiety, it must be stillness

1069
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
And silence

1070
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Jesus

1071
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Search me

1072
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Search me

1073
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Jesus that I might find where there's friction

1074
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Search me, Jesus, that I might find where there's friction.

1075
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Search me, Jesus, to uncover the lie, the fiction that's undergirding that friction.

1076
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,000
When I can't name them, will you name them, my anxious thoughts, Jesus?

1077
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Will you lead me in the way everlasting?

1078
01:01:42,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Father, would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives?

1079
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Would you hear your name?

1080
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
The name that rescues, that breaks through into the darkness, Jesus.

1081
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Jesus.

1082
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
It is in your name that we pray, Jesus.

1083
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Amen.

1084
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Let it break, and your name still, call the seed of still, the rage and need of still, every way.

1085
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
And your name, Jesus, Jesus.

1086
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1087
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

1088
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1089
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:39,000
We call these bones to live, and call these lungs to sing once again.

1090
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I will praise Jesus, Jesus.

1091
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1092
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:00,000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

1093
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1094
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Jesus, Jesus.

1095
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1096
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:28,000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

1097
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:37,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1098
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Jesus, Jesus.

1099
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:48,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1100
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:55,000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

1101
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:04,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1102
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Would you do this? Would you just stand together?

1103
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
One of the things that, you probably heard me say this before, if you've been around, which is when we're singing, we're setting our collective prayer to music.

1104
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,000
That's all we're doing.

1105
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And there's some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same time, in the same place.

1106
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
There's something that happens in that, and I don't know how to explain it, I just know that it does.

1107
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:37,000
And so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices, to sing that one more time together, and then I'll close out our time.

1108
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
So would you lead us in that?

1109
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
We sing Jesus, Jesus.

1110
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1111
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

1112
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:08,000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

1113
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing?

1114
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Where there is darkness that needs to tremble, you can call in the name of Jesus.

1115
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety and depression and loneliness and isolation?

1116
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:35,000
May you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God, search me and know my anxious thoughts.

1117
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:42,000
See if there's a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting.

1118
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Whatever you're up against, may you know, may it be conferred upon you the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name.

1119
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
So good to be with you. Amen.

1120
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So great to be together. We'll see you guys later.
