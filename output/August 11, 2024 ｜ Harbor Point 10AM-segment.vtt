Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ. Come on, put those hands.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Let's sing.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
If you believe, won't you put them together?

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
By His blood, I have been severed.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I believe in resurrection.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
He's preparing the place for me.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Far beyond my heart's imagine.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Here's a bird and night I see.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I believe that He's going.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
His return is to blame, it's bright.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Light the altar, keep it burning.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
How could I ever walk away?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Will the Word have saved my life?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
No, I'll never.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

Of the gospel of Jesus.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
How can you believe in Jesus today?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Won't you give him some praise?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We serve a God that is more than able.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
abundantly, a baffle who can ask for things,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
who continue in our worship and sing unto the Lord,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
who trust you to depend on the Lord.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
The Son, when did I start to forget

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
all of the great things you did?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And when did I think, oh, wait,

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
and think for him in possible love?

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
And how did I start to believe

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
that you were sufficient for me?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And why do I talk my sick?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
How can I forgive you?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
How can you believe in God?

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
You see, that you are more than able.

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
You see, that you are more than able.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Say it again.

Because it's easy for you.

06:35.000 --> 06:40.000
And now I see more than I have.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
Oh, I got my confidence back, yeah.

06:45.000 --> 06:52.000
And I put my trust in the one who still does miracle,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
See, you are more than people.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I want you to close your eyes and sing that whole place of faith to sing.

09:23.000 --> 09:33.000
So you are more than people.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Because we have hope in Him.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Hope to live for tomorrow.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Hope to stand in this world.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
See, day makes me darkest.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
But your light is greater.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
You will light our way.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
God, you will light our way.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
And with evil it's rising.

Because you are alive.

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And your light is stronger.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You're always strong.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Once in a while you'll see there is hope.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Give the morning hope.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
In the evening this hope.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Because you're living hope.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Because you're breathing this hope.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
In the middle of the storm.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You're standing right there with me.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
In the middle of the fire.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
You keep hope alive.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you, Lord.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
If my grandma was here, she wouldn't sing it like this.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
She would sing because she lives.

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
I can face tomorrow.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Because Jesus lives.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
All of my fears, they're gone.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
Because I know, I know, I know.

15:21.000 --> 15:30.000
He holds you in His future in life.

15:30.000 --> 15:41.000
It's worth living just because Jesus lives.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It's an old song.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I'm 33, but I got an old soul.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I love those songs.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Can I say one more time?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
Just receive it.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Receive it.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Let it encourage your spirit.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
You do.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
Back in the black church.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
We used to sing songs of people and people would get excited because it was the truth.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.000
Because he lives.

16:00.000 --> 16:09.000
I can face tomorrow because Jesus lives.

16:09.000 --> 16:18.000
All my fears, they're gone.

Get off the stage.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.240
Y'all, hey, oh, I love you too.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.320
I love you too.

17:16.320 --> 17:17.880
Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today.

17:17.880 --> 17:19.040
This is an amazing church.

17:19.040 --> 17:19.880
So glad.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.520
I'm singing with my sister, Brittany, who is Kobe's wife.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.680
And she's singing for the first time in, what, four or five

17:25.680 --> 17:27.320
years?

17:27.320 --> 17:27.820
Jesus.

17:31.820 --> 17:33.920
Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.160
We got the same alma mater in Ohio.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.200
And when I got my first job out of college,

17:38.200 --> 17:40.360
I was living with them in Houston, Texas.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.880
And they let me live there like a little brother for free,

17:42.880 --> 17:44.440
just trying to find my way.

17:44.440 --> 17:48.600
Somehow, I got myself out to California because of Kobe.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.440
And it's cool.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.320
Like, in this moment, I've been singing here and there

17:51.320 --> 17:51.880
here now.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.640
We're getting to lead and love God together again.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.080
So I'm so grateful for both of you.

17:56.080 --> 17:56.640
Love you, Kobe.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.760
Don't y'all love Kobe?

17:58.760 --> 18:01.840
I ain't going to say nothing smart this time.

18:01.840 --> 18:02.280
All right.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.600
Well, I love you too.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.280
And why don't you tell some people around you.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.040
I love you.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.360
And then you may have a seat.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.440
Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.280
We're so glad you're here.

18:15.280 --> 18:18.640
At Harbor Point, giving us more than just a financial

18:18.640 --> 18:19.840
transaction.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.360
It's part of our worship.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.000
It's a tangible, exceptional, and we're

18:23.000 --> 18:24.880
very grateful that you've come here.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.660
And you're here today.

18:26.660 --> 18:27.440
So thank you.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.800
And thanks for joining us.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.100
We're so glad you're here.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.400
At Harbor Point, giving us more than just a financial

18:33.400 --> 18:34.240
transaction.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.920
It's part of our worship.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.400
It's a tangible, exceptional, and it's

18:37.400 --> 18:38.720
an exceptional tour.

18:38.720 --> 18:44.400
It's a tangible expression of our devotion and gratitude to God, demonstrating that our

18:44.400 --> 18:47.240
hearts are centered on Him.

18:47.240 --> 18:52.520
Each week we bring our offerings as an expression of our commitment to God's work in and through

18:52.520 --> 18:54.040
His Church.

18:54.040 --> 18:58.280
Whether this is your first time giving or you're continuing your giving, please take

18:58.280 --> 19:01.920
a look at the various ways you can contribute.

19:01.920 --> 19:04.480
Thank you for your generosity.

19:04.480 --> 19:08.040
We're thrilled to continue our summer series at the Movies.

19:08.040 --> 19:13.200
This year you can enjoy At The Movies at two locations, the Regency Theatre in San Juan

19:13.200 --> 19:19.360
on Sundays at 10am and at Harbor Point for our regular weekend services and don't forget

19:19.360 --> 19:26.240
Encore, bringing our At The Movies experience to Regency Theatre on Thursday nights at 6.30pm.

19:26.240 --> 19:33.120
It's a fantastic opportunity to invite your friends, neighbors, and coworkers.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.680
If you've been a part of Harbor Point for a while, you've heard us say that every good

19:36.680 --> 19:42.520
thing that we do is done through great volunteers, and that's you.

19:42.520 --> 19:48.100
When I think of some of the amazing volunteers, I think of Travis and Tina, who serve so faithfully

19:48.100 --> 19:50.600
on our worship team for Harbor Point's VBS.

19:50.600 --> 19:57.720
We're so grateful for how they gave their time and talents to pour into the next generation.

19:57.720 --> 20:02.600
So if you're already serving at Harbor Point, we would love to say thank you.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.320
Or if you're curious about what it might look like to step into serving, we want to

20:06.320 --> 20:12.600
invite you to our volunteer rally and lunch, Sunday August 18th at 12.45pm.

20:12.600 --> 20:19.800
You can register today through our app or online or through the QR code in front of you.

20:19.800 --> 20:25.940
Men of Harbor Point Man Camp 2024 is just a few weeks away.

20:25.940 --> 20:31.120
This transformative retreat will offer a unique opportunity to step away from the daily life

20:31.120 --> 20:34.680
and connect with God and other men in our community.

20:35.040 --> 20:41.880
You'll experience powerful worship, inspiring messages, and build lasting friendships.

20:41.880 --> 20:48.000
Man Camp will take place at Forest Home from August 23rd to 25th.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.920
As summer comes to a close, student ministries will be holding their end of summer celebrations

20:52.920 --> 20:54.960
over the next couple weeks.

20:54.960 --> 21:00.640
High school will be celebrating with a beach bonfire at Dohini on Thursday, August 15th.

21:00.640 --> 21:07.360
Junior High will be holding their summer celebration here on campus on Thursday, August 22nd.

21:07.360 --> 21:12.240
For more information and to sign up, just scan the QR codes in front of you or go online

21:12.240 --> 21:14.240
to our website.

21:14.240 --> 21:19.200
We would love to see you in person for our at the movie series here at Harbor Point campus

21:19.200 --> 21:24.640
or the Regency Theater, but we thank you so much for joining us online today for our series

21:24.640 --> 21:28.360
on anxiety called A Bag of Angry Bees.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.080
All right, hey everybody, how's it going?

21:31.080 --> 21:33.920
Yeah, you guys chose, you chose the 10 o'clock service.

21:33.920 --> 21:34.920
You love traffic.

21:34.920 --> 21:35.920
You felt like it's raining.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.280
We could get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.420
Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately, like how am I going to put to

21:42.420 --> 21:46.320
test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus, but to find a parking lot that's

21:46.320 --> 21:48.000
miserable and work my way out of it.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
And you did it.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
You found it.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.000
Way to go.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
Glad you guys made it.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
Those of you guys who are in the tent, glad you guys made it.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.680
Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.680
It is so good to be with you guys.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.120
And for those of you guys who are online, of course, we say this every single week.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.040
The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to

22:04.040 --> 22:06.360
be together, because the people of our church are amazing.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.360
And really, you guys are.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.520
I'm really grateful to be with you guys.

22:08.520 --> 22:09.520
So fun.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.840
And I know you had to drive today through a puddle.

22:12.840 --> 22:15.920
You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car.

22:15.920 --> 22:16.920
And you made it.

22:16.920 --> 22:17.920
It's incredible.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.920
So great stuff happened.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.920
And let's get right to it.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.120
We have a lot to cover as we talk about this.

22:21.120 --> 22:25.120
By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff, and I just want to make sure we're clear.

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
We do not have all the answers.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
This is not a church.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.120
We have everything figured out.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.120
Here's what we know.

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
We're looking at Jesus.

22:30.120 --> 22:34.260
We believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus, and that requires everybody

22:34.260 --> 22:36.200
to help us along the way.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.280
Everybody's got a next step in that.

22:37.280 --> 22:40.640
So whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus, you're investigating the church

22:40.640 --> 22:43.840
or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take.

22:43.840 --> 22:47.240
And our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all

22:47.240 --> 22:48.240
together.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.200
We're a work in progress kind of people doing that stuff.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.320
So however that is, grateful that you're here.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.320
Let's get right to it.

22:53.320 --> 22:57.680
I'm going to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention

22:57.680 --> 22:58.680
as you watch this commercial.

22:58.680 --> 23:02.680
Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person, okay?

23:02.680 --> 23:05.520
But I recognize it, it's fine.

23:05.520 --> 23:11.120
But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.120
Check this out, okay?

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
Here we go.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.440
Mary Clary, thanks for her zipper bags are the best, and we'll never switch to Gladlock

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
zipper bags.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
That's right, never.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.640
And Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here with either your

23:23.640 --> 23:28.080
bag filled with angry bees or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees?

23:28.080 --> 23:30.160
See that green color chain seal there, Mary?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.120
That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.320
Your bag doesn't have a green seal.

23:34.320 --> 23:35.840
You know, change is good.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.400
I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag.

23:38.400 --> 23:39.400
Just kidding, Mary.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.320
When it really counts, don't get mad.

23:41.320 --> 23:42.760
Get Gladlock zipper bags.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.800
Okay, some of you remember this commercial.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.440
Now, what I want to, obviously this is, it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over

23:48.440 --> 23:50.680
analyzing it and taking it way too seriously, okay?

23:50.680 --> 23:51.800
That's the gift I bring.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.680
But let's look at this for a moment.

23:53.680 --> 23:57.520
This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.640
Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which

24:00.640 --> 24:04.400
makes the green thing, which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was

24:04.400 --> 24:05.400
so crucial.

24:05.400 --> 24:10.360
And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag would you rather have hold

24:10.360 --> 24:13.480
the angry bees that we're going to give you?

24:13.480 --> 24:18.200
And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed

24:18.200 --> 24:19.800
to do this.

24:19.800 --> 24:24.920
The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea that these

24:24.920 --> 24:29.240
people who are making this scenario happen not only have they got bees to give a person

24:29.240 --> 24:33.280
to hold, but also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth.

24:33.280 --> 24:38.960
And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is, it's like an elevator that

24:38.960 --> 24:39.960
doesn't go anywhere.

24:39.960 --> 24:40.960
That's all that it is.

24:40.960 --> 24:41.960
It's the same thing.

24:41.960 --> 24:44.680
It's not a phone, but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.120
But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which

24:48.120 --> 24:49.880
they're agreeing to do.

24:49.880 --> 24:53.200
And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

24:53.200 --> 24:56.200
How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.880
I don't want to do any of this.

24:57.880 --> 24:59.520
I don't care what bag you use.

24:59.520 --> 25:00.800
I'm not doing this.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.200
This whole thing is stupid.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.040
The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her

25:05.040 --> 25:06.040
in this thing.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.000
How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.840
The question is, and why are people saying yes to this?

25:10.840 --> 25:15.080
The question over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.560
The question is, well, who's in charge here?

25:17.560 --> 25:19.080
Who thought this was a good idea?

25:19.080 --> 25:20.480
Who thought this would be okay?

25:20.480 --> 25:24.000
Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person

25:24.000 --> 25:25.680
and says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth.

25:25.680 --> 25:30.000
The whole thing is bizarre and absurd and who's in charge here?

25:30.000 --> 25:37.040
Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety.

25:37.040 --> 25:38.040
Who's in charge here?

25:38.760 --> 25:42.280
We're in week two of a series called the bag of angry bees and it's a series on anxiety

25:42.280 --> 25:47.000
because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
But I want to catch us up a little bit.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.720
If you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing field

25:50.720 --> 25:54.400
as we talk about this idea of anxiety, one of the things we said last week was this,

25:54.400 --> 25:57.960
is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety.

25:57.960 --> 26:02.560
Fear is the response to something that has happened, like bear, person with a knife coming

26:02.560 --> 26:03.560
after us.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.960
Oh my gosh, that's fear.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.400
Anxiety is what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?

26:08.400 --> 26:09.400
That's anxiety.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.400
Are you with me?

26:10.400 --> 26:13.400
One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.720
And we said that generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing

26:16.720 --> 26:21.560
that's happening or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern but in anxiety

26:21.560 --> 26:26.440
we take that up to an unreasonable response level or an unreasonable sort of anticipation

26:26.440 --> 26:27.440
level.

26:27.440 --> 26:28.440
Are you with me?

26:28.440 --> 26:31.840
Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something

26:31.840 --> 26:32.840
in common.

26:32.880 --> 26:38.120
Anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty.

26:38.120 --> 26:42.400
It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain.

26:42.400 --> 26:46.040
And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

26:46.040 --> 26:49.280
all of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety.

26:49.280 --> 26:52.840
It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current

26:52.840 --> 26:56.920
statistics on this, which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone,

26:56.920 --> 27:01.680
you have someone in your house perhaps, or you yourself as someone who has anxiety.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.560
And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you

27:04.560 --> 27:07.920
grew up or what kind of healthy environment you might have encountered, some of you got

27:07.920 --> 27:12.800
the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety, the best solution

27:12.800 --> 27:16.320
is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it.

27:16.320 --> 27:19.040
Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it.

27:19.040 --> 27:23.680
It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff, compensate by being high functioning

27:23.680 --> 27:27.600
and just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it because you shouldn't

27:27.600 --> 27:29.800
have to deal with it, just snap out of it.

27:29.800 --> 27:33.800
And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told

27:33.800 --> 27:36.240
us, we were told, here's what you should do.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.840
Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you, and then by comparison

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
you won't care anymore.

27:40.840 --> 27:44.720
You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people.

27:44.720 --> 27:48.000
Yeah, so I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either

27:48.000 --> 27:50.800
of the anxieties, in either case.

27:50.800 --> 27:54.200
And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like,

27:54.200 --> 27:57.720
you know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower who maybe

27:57.720 --> 28:00.800
they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know I'm suffering

28:00.800 --> 28:03.480
from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression.

28:03.480 --> 28:07.160
And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you, don't be anxious about anything.

28:07.160 --> 28:08.160
Thank you so much.

28:08.160 --> 28:13.440
And they're like, well, don't be anxious, but in everything, in every situation by prayer

28:13.440 --> 28:15.560
and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.480
And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.120
I guess I'm not supposed to have this because the solution to having anxiety is apparently

28:22.120 --> 28:23.120
just don't.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.600
And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal

28:26.640 --> 28:28.800
with it as a shame thing because I'm not supposed to have it.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.360
And so it never really gets dealt with at all.

28:32.360 --> 28:36.920
The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level.

28:36.920 --> 28:41.040
And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question, who's

28:41.040 --> 28:43.160
in charge?

28:43.160 --> 28:46.000
A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
charge?

28:47.000 --> 28:50.600
What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way, my feelings or my

28:50.600 --> 28:51.680
thoughts are in charge.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.680
I'm not in charge.

28:52.680 --> 28:53.680
Not me.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.680
I'm not in charge.

28:55.680 --> 28:57.080
And this is where it starts.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.080
This is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue.

28:59.080 --> 29:02.360
In other words, probably another way to say it is this.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.840
Anxiety has a double effect.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.880
There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety,

29:06.880 --> 29:08.160
to say it this way.

29:08.160 --> 29:12.040
I'm freaking out about freaking out.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.120
And this is why people get stuck in it.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.600
It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough.

29:16.600 --> 29:20.640
It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety, like what am I supposed to do with this thing

29:20.640 --> 29:24.400
when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral and you maybe have this experience

29:24.480 --> 29:26.760
or do you know people who do?

29:26.760 --> 29:28.760
And here's what I want to do today.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.480
I want to give us one tool.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.040
It's not the answer to everything.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.400
It doesn't solve all the anxiety.

29:33.400 --> 29:37.960
It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool that also requires a pretty

29:37.960 --> 29:41.320
significant amount of courage as well.

29:41.320 --> 29:45.040
It's just going to, and just again, to make sure we reiterate, I'm not an expert.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.680
Someone told you we're doing a series on anxiety.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.720
You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure

29:48.720 --> 29:53.280
about Jesus, but I will come hear that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on

29:53.280 --> 29:54.280
this.

29:55.160 --> 29:55.920
I'm not a therapist.

29:55.920 --> 29:56.920
This is not my degree.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.480
I'm a fellow traveler in this.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.320
I do a little bit of research on some stuff.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.280
I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.880
My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys.

30:04.880 --> 30:09.040
But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.280
And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.600
But I also want to tell you this, fair warning.

30:13.600 --> 30:17.560
The way we're going to get to this one tool is a very windy road.

30:17.560 --> 30:21.920
Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.840
I don't appreciate the laughter.

30:23.840 --> 30:24.840
It's fine.

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
It's fine.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.680
But you're going to be like, what in the world are we doing?

30:28.680 --> 30:31.200
And then I promise I will bring it back home.

30:31.200 --> 30:35.240
But you're going to wonder for a little bit, because I'm going to start in a place you

30:35.240 --> 30:36.240
may not expect.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.800
And then we're going to get there.

30:37.800 --> 30:44.840
So I'm going to start in ancient Near Eastern temple construction, because that's where

30:44.840 --> 30:45.840
you thought I was going to go.

30:45.840 --> 30:46.840
Right in here.

30:46.840 --> 30:47.840
That's where we'll start.

30:47.840 --> 30:48.840
Here's what we're going to do.

30:48.840 --> 30:49.840
I'm totally serious.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.680
Ancient Near Eastern temple construction.

30:51.680 --> 30:52.680
Here's what happens.

30:53.040 --> 30:54.800
The first of the phases starts like this.

30:54.800 --> 30:57.000
It's the boundary making of a particular thing.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
Here's where things are.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Here's where things are.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.960
This separates the sacred space from the not-sacred space, boundary making.

31:02.960 --> 31:07.520
Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filling of things and some further separation

31:07.520 --> 31:08.520
of things.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.600
There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces which are separated from other spaces.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.280
All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East.

31:14.280 --> 31:19.840
And the sixth phase of the temple construction, whatever it is, whatever god that's being

31:19.840 --> 31:23.160
worshipped there, a statue typically is placed within there on the sixth phase.

31:23.160 --> 31:27.400
So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation, sort of this creation

31:27.400 --> 31:28.400
of a temple.

31:28.400 --> 31:33.160
And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple to give people

31:33.160 --> 31:36.880
an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple.

31:36.880 --> 31:41.240
Now there are six days, there's a seven day creation, but there's a six day creation

31:41.240 --> 31:42.240
narrative in the Bible.

31:42.240 --> 31:45.080
Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.800
So god created mankind in his own image and the image of god, he created them male and

31:48.800 --> 31:49.800
female.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.240
This is the sixth day of creation.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.120
Now let me pause right here for a second.

31:53.120 --> 31:59.200
What's being said by this, many scholars agree, that the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation

31:59.200 --> 32:01.880
narrative in the Bible, which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that

32:01.880 --> 32:05.240
yet, that's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this, that the whole cosmos,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.600
the Bible will say, is god's temple, the entire thing.

32:08.600 --> 32:13.600
No temple could contain him, so the whole cosmos is his temple and instead of a statue

32:13.600 --> 32:19.680
on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day, it's a person, people become the representation

32:19.680 --> 32:23.760
of this god in his temple, the whole cosmos.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.940
But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28.

32:27.940 --> 32:31.200
God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth

32:31.200 --> 32:35.160
and subdue it, some translations, and have dominion over it.

32:35.160 --> 32:40.000
Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and over every living creature

32:40.000 --> 32:44.160
that moves on the ground.

32:44.160 --> 32:48.200
So the people aren't just simply decoration, there's more there, they're blessed and they're

32:48.200 --> 32:52.600
told to multiply and have dominion and the answer to the question, who's in charge of

32:52.600 --> 32:54.520
all of the created stuff?

32:54.520 --> 32:57.460
The answer is, people are.

32:57.460 --> 33:01.560
People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation.

33:01.560 --> 33:07.760
In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to is God himself.

33:07.760 --> 33:10.520
Other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.880
It's a gift to Genesis chapter two, where it gets a little bit more specific about some

33:13.880 --> 33:14.880
of this stuff.

33:14.880 --> 33:18.640
Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all

33:18.640 --> 33:23.760
the birds of the sky, and he brought them to the man to see what he would name them.

33:23.760 --> 33:27.240
And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.280
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.

33:31.280 --> 33:34.600
Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man, this created, this image of

33:34.600 --> 33:40.600
God placed into this whole cosmos, which now has this responsibility to name everything.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.160
Again, this might be a challenge for some of you, like I'm not sure I believe, just

33:43.280 --> 33:46.760
stay with the point of what's happening here, because here's what's happening in naming.

33:46.760 --> 33:50.480
Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.400
Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this, the first thing

33:53.400 --> 33:56.320
that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing.

33:56.320 --> 34:01.000
So when someone names a thing, it says, this is a that and I'm not that.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
That's not me.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.240
Over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is, from me, that's separate from

34:06.240 --> 34:07.740
me.

34:07.740 --> 34:12.600
Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me, does that make sense?

34:12.640 --> 34:15.960
This is differentiation, you're different than me, that's what's being said, when we

34:15.960 --> 34:16.960
name a thing.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.960
Secondly, what happens in naming is sort of an authority over.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.360
Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.440
So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not

34:28.440 --> 34:33.040
me, but it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named.

34:33.040 --> 34:36.920
This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament,

34:36.920 --> 34:40.400
the Old Covenant, part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really

34:40.440 --> 34:43.560
interesting kind of conversation about names.

34:43.560 --> 34:47.480
Not least of which is the name of God, which is kind of, if you read Moses' interaction

34:47.480 --> 34:51.440
with God in the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before, but one

34:51.440 --> 34:54.720
of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool, what do I tell people your name is as if to

34:54.720 --> 34:57.480
say, because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.820
It's so unbelievably important and sacred, in fact, to this day.

35:01.820 --> 35:07.840
You will find very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God, they'll

35:07.880 --> 35:14.880
refer to God as this word, Hashem, who is in that word simply means the name.

35:15.880 --> 35:20.000
Like we can't even, we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God, because it's

35:20.000 --> 35:23.840
so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment, so the word simply to describe

35:23.840 --> 35:27.120
God is just the name.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.600
Names are crucial.

35:28.600 --> 35:32.800
Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible, but you know this, even nicknaming has rules.

35:32.800 --> 35:37.120
Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up, maybe you still go by that nickname,

35:37.120 --> 35:40.480
maybe introduce yourself as a particular name, maybe you know like, but there's some

35:40.480 --> 35:43.040
rules that go along with that, you know that there's rules about that.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.680
Now the first rule of nicknaming is, you don't get to choose your own nickname, you don't

35:47.680 --> 35:51.840
get to decide, like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know, now I'm going

35:51.840 --> 35:57.680
by MacGyver, kind of rhymes with McGuire, plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know,

35:57.680 --> 36:01.480
like the gum and like a, you know, rubber band and he could like, oh look, let's fly

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
away and escape.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.600
He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a, like a scuba tank, he could save

36:06.600 --> 36:08.800
the world, you know, I was like, that's, that's me, I'm going by McGuire, you guys

36:08.800 --> 36:12.400
are coming by McGyver now, woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work, that's not how

36:12.400 --> 36:16.280
it goes, you can't choose your nickname, you don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed

36:16.280 --> 36:20.240
upon you, and the way it always works is sort of a top-down method, either the leader, the

36:20.240 --> 36:24.200
group of a person is like, you're now this, or the group decides, hey we've decided you're

36:24.200 --> 36:28.000
going by this nickname, you'll get to choose it, you can't declare it, it's what we've

36:28.000 --> 36:31.560
all decided because it's a top-down method, it's the way it works, it never gets to be

36:31.560 --> 36:35.800
the other way, it's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of ascribing a nickname

36:35.880 --> 36:41.760
to a person, and there's always, it tends to be, not always, but tends to be a moment

36:41.760 --> 36:45.840
of like kind of mockery that's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of a little bit

36:45.840 --> 36:50.000
funny but it's based in truth, it always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that,

36:50.000 --> 36:54.560
you know, so I can never figure out, even to this day, why my 12-year-old soccer coach

36:54.560 --> 36:59.360
called me lanky, I can't figure out what the truth was in there, I don't really know, that's

36:59.360 --> 37:02.920
weird, anyway, so anyway, where was I going, now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your

37:02.960 --> 37:07.240
own name, right, you guys watch Seinfeld and maybe you saw George try to be called T-Bone

37:07.240 --> 37:10.840
and never really kind of panned out for him, the top-down method is how this works, remember

37:10.840 --> 37:14.000
this, this is going to matter in a second, and there's always an element of sort of truth

37:14.000 --> 37:19.200
and mockery that kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff, now, in Luke chapter 8,

37:19.200 --> 37:23.240
Jesus encounters a man, this man is what we would call demonized, he's possessed by a

37:23.240 --> 37:28.080
demon, and what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs, he doesn't

37:28.120 --> 37:33.440
have a house, he's all by himself, now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late

37:33.440 --> 37:37.760
modern world, we have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

37:37.760 --> 37:42.120
or demon possession, couple of different things, one of the things we tend to think, looking

37:42.120 --> 37:46.320
back into the Bible as we go, look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis,

37:46.320 --> 37:49.520
anytime anybody had something sort of, some sort of mental illness, they would just naturally

37:49.520 --> 37:54.280
ascribe it to demon, oh, that's a demon, that's what that is, and I just want to say, you

37:54.960 --> 37:59.320
might be right, but I also want to just propose something else, the Bible does talk about

37:59.320 --> 38:04.160
a spiritual dimension of reality that is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on

38:04.160 --> 38:07.680
a regular ongoing basis and sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that

38:07.680 --> 38:13.160
are happening, and I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic,

38:13.160 --> 38:17.200
people who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak,

38:17.200 --> 38:22.160
and yet there is still in the Bible this description of things that where demons, spirit beings

38:22.240 --> 38:27.960
are at work against what God is trying to do, and here's what I just want to say, the

38:27.960 --> 38:32.840
one does not exclude the other, there is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose

38:32.840 --> 38:37.120
back in the first century, and there is also demonic activity that's also at work, so I

38:37.120 --> 38:40.040
just want to make sure we're all clear on that, are we okay moving forward with this?

38:40.040 --> 38:45.080
Okay, good, here we go, now here's the scene, Luke 8, 26, they sailed to the regions of

38:45.080 --> 38:48.680
the Jeresians which is across the lake from Galilee, so this is in the northern part of

38:48.720 --> 38:52.920
Israel, there's two big lakes, there's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea,

38:52.920 --> 38:56.080
Dead Sea's way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee's much more important because things live there,

38:56.080 --> 39:00.200
and on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other

39:00.200 --> 39:05.360
side, this is where people don't go very often, but when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a

39:05.360 --> 39:10.000
demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a

39:10.000 --> 39:13.360
house, but had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again, this is this person who lives

39:13.480 --> 39:18.960
by himself naked in the tombs, and this man runs up to Jesus, and when he saw Jesus he cried out

39:18.960 --> 39:23.040
and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what's important to keep in mind. When you

39:23.040 --> 39:26.480
see this, and the story's also in Mark chapter 5, you can read this story, and one of the things

39:26.480 --> 39:31.480
that's crucial when you see it is there's always this really difficult distinction between, it's

39:31.480 --> 39:35.440
hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking, who's talking here, is the

39:35.440 --> 39:38.960
demon or is it the guy, what I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of

39:39.040 --> 39:42.720
keep it, it's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me.

39:42.720 --> 39:47.360
Now, when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what do

39:47.360 --> 39:52.880
you want with me Jesus, Son of the Most High God, I beg you don't torture me. So this is such an

39:52.880 --> 39:59.040
interesting kind of encounter, some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

39:59.840 --> 40:05.120
is an attempt to gain control over Jesus, which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know

40:05.200 --> 40:09.360
rule number two, it's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this,

40:09.360 --> 40:13.920
this is what's going to be shown in a moment here, but there's this this sort of crying out of

40:13.920 --> 40:18.240
Jesus's name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him, verse 29, for Jesus had commanded the

40:18.240 --> 40:22.000
impure spirit to come out of the man, this is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence, like the

40:22.000 --> 40:26.480
reason why this guy is saying this is because of this, so Luke is recording what happened, he's

40:26.480 --> 40:30.880
like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever, is because

40:30.960 --> 40:34.560
of this right here, for Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man,

40:34.560 --> 40:38.560
and many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard,

40:38.560 --> 40:43.120
he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places, let's pause here

40:43.120 --> 40:49.520
for a second, so often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness,

40:51.520 --> 40:56.800
so often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness, it isn't that the man

40:56.800 --> 41:00.720
was like, oh man, I feel like I got a thing, I got a ghost, it's that the thing itself drove him

41:01.280 --> 41:12.480
into the solitary places to be alone, then Jesus asked him, what is your name?

41:17.200 --> 41:21.440
Legion, he replied, because many demons had gone into him, the word Legion to talk about a Roman

41:21.520 --> 41:27.200
Legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers, so the idea of this means that there's

41:27.200 --> 41:36.640
a ton of demonic activity in this particular person, what is your name? The question that's

41:36.640 --> 41:42.720
being asked here is who's in charge, things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly

41:42.720 --> 41:48.480
taking control of the moment, and Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to

41:48.480 --> 41:53.760
fly in the face of the whole idea here, the demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus

41:53.760 --> 41:58.560
because of, you know, he's able to like name him, what's being said here is that there is in fact

41:58.560 --> 42:04.960
Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing and takes control of the moment, and then there's this

42:04.960 --> 42:09.840
tragic comic kind of thing that happens next is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets

42:09.840 --> 42:15.440
cast out into a herd of pigs which are nearby apparently, and then the pigs run into a lake

42:15.440 --> 42:20.000
and drown, that's the story, they're like we're possessed, and they drown, that's it, I mean

42:20.000 --> 42:23.200
that was a galloping pig by the way, if those of you guys are wondering that's what galloping pigs

42:23.200 --> 42:30.320
look like, and they run away and they drown, now the question that you have which is a fair question

42:30.320 --> 42:38.320
is what does this have to do with anybody's anxiety, let me tell you, one of the things that

42:38.320 --> 42:43.360
happens in anxiety is this, one of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a

42:43.360 --> 42:47.600
fusion, a linking and overlapping between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers

42:47.600 --> 42:52.480
from anxiety or depression and that person themselves, they make it their identity, it's

42:52.480 --> 42:55.360
one of the most tragic things that happens, one of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in

42:55.360 --> 43:01.520
her own anxiety, her own anxiety journey, this is my wife, she said, I realized I had to stop

43:01.520 --> 43:05.680
just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety, who I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm

43:05.680 --> 43:09.600
always anxious, I'm anxious, she finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed,

43:09.600 --> 43:13.120
maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious, this was something that was a problem that

43:13.120 --> 43:19.200
needed to be addressed, fusing the two things together, Curtis Chang and his book which I

43:19.200 --> 43:22.000
mentioned before and I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them or

43:22.000 --> 43:25.760
take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know, no just kidding, but if you

43:25.760 --> 43:30.240
want to borrow it it's fine, but we have a couple, his book's great but here's one of the things he

43:30.240 --> 43:35.760
says to this very effect, when we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety

43:35.760 --> 43:41.280
for extended periods, I love the language, we identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts

43:41.280 --> 43:47.600
that our minds fuse with these thoughts, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we

43:47.600 --> 43:50.800
play it over and over and over again, we talked about this last week about ruminating, the more we

43:50.800 --> 43:55.360
rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa,

43:57.440 --> 44:03.840
the more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads, the more we become indistinguishable

44:03.840 --> 44:09.840
from that narrative, such that we cannot abandon those thoughts and this mental fusion can be so

44:09.840 --> 44:18.480
complete we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked, in other words when we start

44:18.480 --> 44:22.720
having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads and it starts

44:22.720 --> 44:31.760
to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating, you can see where this is going,

44:31.760 --> 44:39.040
we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us and find a way to rein

44:39.040 --> 44:52.960
it in, so here's what we need to do, name it, name it, we have to call the thing whatever the

44:52.960 --> 44:58.560
thing is we have to call it what it is so that we can separate it from ourselves, here's what Curtis

44:58.560 --> 45:04.400
Chang says once again, when we can name our thoughts we recognize them as distinct from us

45:05.360 --> 45:11.120
differentiation, we're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in

45:11.120 --> 45:16.080
our minds but they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation,

45:16.080 --> 45:23.920
there's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us,

45:26.320 --> 45:30.720
when I named my anxious thoughts he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them,

45:30.800 --> 45:34.160
the more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them,

45:34.800 --> 45:39.200
the more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify, the more I watched those thoughts

45:39.200 --> 45:43.040
with detached observation and not engagement and the more I said, oh I recognize you,

45:43.760 --> 45:54.480
the more the anxious thoughts faded away, so let's call it what it is, we've got to name it,

45:55.440 --> 46:01.200
we've got to name it and the question you have which is a fair question is, how do I name it,

46:01.200 --> 46:04.400
I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do

46:04.400 --> 46:08.480
with it and I just want to tell you again we're just going to look at kind of this is the very

46:08.480 --> 46:11.760
beginning stages of stuff but let's just talk about this for a moment, one of the most helpful

46:11.760 --> 46:16.160
ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in

46:16.160 --> 46:22.960
your life, where are things not going smoothly, where's their friction, in other words take a

46:22.960 --> 46:27.280
different way, can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated,

46:27.280 --> 46:30.800
afraid, etc, where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing,

46:32.800 --> 46:37.920
for instance if you're going through Del Taco and you're like they give you the wrong hot sauce

46:37.920 --> 46:41.280
and you're like that's a bummer they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho and they

46:41.280 --> 46:46.480
gave me regular old lame hot sauce and you're like that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response,

46:46.480 --> 46:49.120
if you're like they didn't give me del scorcho I'm burning the place down,

46:49.760 --> 46:55.600
by the way that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho okay but I'm just saying

46:55.600 --> 47:00.160
that there's a moment where you're like that my response should be a two but it feels like it's

47:00.160 --> 47:04.800
a 12, this is probably where you're going maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to

47:04.800 --> 47:08.800
figure out what's going on here, there's a pattern where I'm overreacting it should be a two and I'm

47:08.800 --> 47:12.720
giving it a 12 out of 10, something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for

47:12.720 --> 47:20.800
all of us and they're all different kinds of scales, for me confession okay, I have to be very

47:20.800 --> 47:25.680
very careful anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children

47:31.200 --> 47:34.640
because there's a part of me and I've told you guys this before that if you're with us last week

47:34.640 --> 47:39.360
I said the thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been

47:39.360 --> 47:43.200
chasing me is this right here being a disappointment and being irrelevant these are the things that

47:43.200 --> 47:49.200
come up with now in a competition anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser not just lose

47:49.200 --> 47:56.640
but be a loser it's right into this stuff so I have a level of intensity with my own kids in

47:56.640 --> 48:04.160
competition which is really I have to measure and some things I can't do whether it's like doing

48:04.160 --> 48:07.440
things that's like an activity we do together like surfing it's like my kids are all better

48:07.440 --> 48:11.760
surfers than me by a long shot but I'm like you know I just I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as

48:11.760 --> 48:16.480
they are they're in there like my oldest is 20 he lives like it goes to school right next to the

48:16.480 --> 48:21.360
beach he serves constantly he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes I'm like what's wrong with the

48:21.360 --> 48:25.280
world anyway but he does that he's awesome and my other kids are incredible all the things they do

48:25.280 --> 48:28.800
and I'm like I'm out and it's like I'm making it a competition and I have to win we're playing

48:28.800 --> 48:33.760
cards we're playing horse and how much does it matter if I'm like playing horse with my son how

48:33.840 --> 48:41.440
important is it that I win crucial is the answer to that question but it should be a two and it's

48:41.440 --> 48:45.920
a 12 why does it matter I have to be very careful with these things where's their friction name it

48:45.920 --> 48:49.680
you have to find some of the friction is probably one of the most helpful things you can do but

48:49.680 --> 48:52.880
there's another layer to this and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult and it's

48:52.880 --> 48:56.640
nonetheless crucial and by the way I have to apologize in advance is where I give you this

48:56.640 --> 49:02.720
okay I'm gonna show you it in a second it rhymes okay and I always am afraid when it rhymes like

49:02.720 --> 49:06.000
oh gosh we just packaged this up in a little neat little thing and there's probably a little

49:06.000 --> 49:09.760
slight little tiny if you look closely a little tm on the top right of the circle around it like

49:09.760 --> 49:12.800
trademark there's nothing I just want to make sure I want you to make sure you remember it

49:13.360 --> 49:17.520
but for those of you guys that have a high like really sensitive cheese meter this is gonna set

49:17.520 --> 49:23.680
you off okay it's very cheesy but it's really crucial okay so bear with me okay you guys you

49:23.680 --> 49:28.080
guys ready for I think you can handle this okay so not only are we finding the friction where is

49:28.080 --> 49:32.960
there this ongoing sort of pattern where I'm overreacting to certain things but bear with me

49:32.960 --> 49:40.400
you probably what is more crucial than that is to find the fiction behind the friction I do not

49:40.400 --> 49:52.640
appreciate that sir because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie behind every anxiety

49:52.720 --> 49:59.360
that we feel is a near perfect lie like wow that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about

49:59.360 --> 50:02.960
a particular thing and the thing that people that you may not be you but people that are around you

50:02.960 --> 50:07.440
that might suffer from anxiety they're believing a particular lie that's being rehearsed over and

50:07.440 --> 50:12.000
over again in their head and it's nearly perfect and the question we have to ask which is a very

50:12.000 --> 50:15.760
courageous question which may require actual therapy you might have to go to a person who

50:15.760 --> 50:22.800
can help you uncover this stuff but the point is there is 99 percent I'm gonna go 100 percent okay

50:23.520 --> 50:29.040
there's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety there is a perfect lie behind

50:29.040 --> 50:35.280
it and to ask the question where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial

50:36.880 --> 50:40.480
behind the anxiety is a particular lie I showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down

50:40.480 --> 50:44.240
and it's a lie let me give you some things to think about if you if you're having trouble kind of

50:44.240 --> 50:48.000
identifying it this is not going to answer every question but maybe some of these you might connect

50:48.000 --> 50:53.760
with okay here if blank happens it means I've lost control and when I lose control the whole world

50:53.760 --> 50:58.640
goes it just whatever I just I have to be in control and if something happens it means I've

50:58.640 --> 51:04.560
lost control it could be any number of things for you in can be small and it can be big it can be I

51:04.560 --> 51:08.240
I'm late for dropping my kids off for school I'm late for picking up it could be I'm late for school

51:08.240 --> 51:12.240
it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in it could be if I don't

51:12.240 --> 51:16.720
connect with these people if I mess up my own if I don't get on Instagram enough times I don't see

51:16.720 --> 51:23.600
these things it means I've lost control some of you might have this scenario there won't there

51:23.600 --> 51:28.240
won't be enough I know what will happen there's just not going to be enough blank filling whatever

51:28.240 --> 51:34.560
you want there money attention affection love I know that if I say yes to this now then there

51:34.560 --> 51:39.520
won't be enough later or if this person says yes to this in my life there's only a certain there's

51:39.520 --> 51:43.360
like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need and if they take a slice it's going to be

51:43.360 --> 51:47.680
one less thing available for me or for anybody else or just won't be enough of whatever it is

51:47.680 --> 51:54.720
you can maybe that's you some of you have this if I can't blank well whatever it is I'll be alone

51:56.560 --> 52:01.760
if I can't do well as a student if I don't perform well at my job if I'm not a good friend if I

52:01.760 --> 52:06.400
don't appear wonder if I don't do beauty well if I don't do personal health and fitness well

52:06.400 --> 52:11.040
if I don't do living the California life well then I'll be all alone and people won't want me

52:13.360 --> 52:18.320
that may be you some people have this one just connects with a lot of people

52:18.960 --> 52:25.040
things are going so great but now what like I know everything's awesome but that only means

52:25.040 --> 52:29.920
there's an impending doom right around the corner I feel like things are going great my

52:29.920 --> 52:32.720
friendships are great maybe you're single and you got all your crew of friends you're like we're

52:32.720 --> 52:36.800
getting along great and we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing

52:37.920 --> 52:41.760
it's all gonna go it's something's gonna happen immediately maybe you're a person who's got a

52:41.760 --> 52:45.440
mom group and you're all hanging out things are incredible you've got your kids and your marriages

52:45.440 --> 52:49.200
are incredible and you're like it's just a it's a matter of time for everything goes away there's

52:49.200 --> 52:52.240
going to be a disease there's going to be a volcano there's going to be something that

52:52.240 --> 52:56.640
swallows us up we're all going to die I just know it there'll be a puddle on the way to church I mean

52:56.640 --> 53:00.880
you know you never know a lot of people have this things are going great but they can't forever

53:00.880 --> 53:07.040
just waiting for the thing the house of cards to fall that's an anxiety some people have this

53:07.040 --> 53:10.960
that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do however I try to communicate

53:10.960 --> 53:15.600
who I am I'll never be fully understood which is a matter of being not loved and being alone once

53:15.600 --> 53:18.960
again I just cannot be an understood person and this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious

53:18.960 --> 53:27.360
state some people have this what if we what if I or we never get through blank we're a tough

53:27.360 --> 53:31.200
patch in our marriage I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life I want to meet the

53:31.200 --> 53:34.720
I want to meet Mr. Right I want to meet Mrs. Right I want to be I want to be I want to be around

53:34.720 --> 53:38.480
these bad what if I I but like I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it and

53:38.480 --> 53:41.840
what if I don't get through what if we never get through it what if the tough spot of my marriage

53:41.840 --> 53:46.640
or the disease or the illness I never get through it what if that never happens what I'm just preparing

53:46.640 --> 53:49.760
myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel so what if I never

53:49.760 --> 53:57.000
get through it. All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the

53:57.000 --> 54:02.160
things that we're worried about and they generate for us a kind of anxiety about

54:02.160 --> 54:05.720
this stuff and for some of you it may not be you like I said you may not be the

54:05.720 --> 54:08.280
person who's got anxiety you may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all

54:08.280 --> 54:10.480
that kind of stuff but you probably live with people and you're like why are they

54:10.480 --> 54:15.560
reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2 because there's probably a fiction

54:15.560 --> 54:21.560
behind it that's generating that sort of thing. Now what do we do with that? Now

54:21.560 --> 54:26.640
this is really important depending this what we do with that depends really

54:26.640 --> 54:31.760
crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus. You with me? Some of

54:31.760 --> 54:34.760
you are like look I'm okay with Jesus I came because you're talking about anxiety

54:34.760 --> 54:38.120
there's some cool stuff but I just want to tell you this is there's a dimension

54:38.120 --> 54:41.160
that we're gonna talk about here which is so important to like understanding

54:41.160 --> 54:44.720
what it is to walk with Jesus because there's a spiritual dimension to faith

54:44.720 --> 54:47.160
it is not just practical help for all these kinds of things you go lots of

54:47.160 --> 54:50.360
places to get that this is and we're okay with that by the way we're church

54:50.360 --> 54:54.120
we're kind of okay with Jesus but I want to try to give you a sense of what we

54:54.120 --> 54:57.320
talk about next that is gonna push this a little further and I think it's

54:57.320 --> 55:00.000
probably what for some of you may be like an invitation to step into something

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
you've not yet considered but here's what I want to do remember when you look

55:04.000 --> 55:07.360
back at this story Jesus with this demonized person this man who's naked

55:07.360 --> 55:13.560
in the tombs it's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon Jesus doesn't need the

55:13.560 --> 55:15.840
name to be able to take control which is really important to keep in mind but

55:15.840 --> 55:19.920
Jesus extracts the name of the demon the demon says his own name Legion the guy

55:19.920 --> 55:24.240
doesn't do it the demons one who drove him into isolation he's the demon he's

55:24.240 --> 55:27.800
the naked demon guy living in the tombs doesn't live at home anymore and even the

55:27.800 --> 55:33.880
guy couldn't name the thing Jesus has to draw it out of this person and maybe for

55:33.880 --> 55:36.640
you when it comes to naming some of this stuff you actually need some

55:36.640 --> 55:41.280
supernatural assistance to do it you actually need this is what Jesus really

55:41.320 --> 55:45.960
can do and the inner stuff all this stuff it's hard requires courage and

55:45.960 --> 55:49.800
humility and this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

55:49.800 --> 55:55.680
let's go back to Philippians 4 6 and 7 do not be anxious about anything but in

55:55.680 --> 55:58.640
every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present request to

55:58.640 --> 56:01.760
God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your

56:01.760 --> 56:04.680
hearts and your minds and Christ Jesus what's so crucial to keep in mind is

56:04.680 --> 56:08.320
every anxious person loves the second part of that the peace of God which

56:08.320 --> 56:11.400
transcends understanding we all want that everybody even if you're not an

56:11.400 --> 56:14.400
anxious person like that sounds great the peace of God which is beyond even my

56:14.400 --> 56:18.840
understanding I want that but what I want to do today is this during everything

56:18.840 --> 56:26.040
in mind I want to focus on this part of that verse prayer and petition when most

56:26.040 --> 56:29.960
of us think about prayer we think about petition which is asking for a

56:29.960 --> 56:32.860
particular thing petition means I'm asking for particularly you know it's

56:32.860 --> 56:36.720
like it's the language of petitions in the First Amendment that we write to

56:36.720 --> 56:39.320
petition the government is part of what's in there like that's actually

56:39.320 --> 56:43.480
gets to ask for a particular thing to make something to make a request a formal

56:43.480 --> 56:46.520
request of a thing which is part of what's being described here in fact even

56:46.520 --> 56:51.240
it says make your request known to God but there's also something else there it

56:51.240 --> 56:55.120
says prayer and petition which they're under the same umbrella but there's

56:55.120 --> 56:59.440
something different about the two things which is worth thinking about because

56:59.440 --> 57:02.480
for a lot of us all we think about is prayers while I ask God for stuff and

57:02.480 --> 57:05.600
then hope he delivers and I'm ready for a couple different answers you know like

57:05.600 --> 57:08.160
maybe you heard that growing up it's like yes you can have what you want no

57:08.160 --> 57:10.960
you can't or you just have to wait around a little while it's like that's

57:10.960 --> 57:14.200
all we know about prayer and I just want to say that there's there's a

57:14.200 --> 57:16.680
beautiful part to that but I just want to kind of expand it a little bit

57:16.680 --> 57:21.840
broader than that because maybe in prayer what we get to do is to seek God to do

57:21.840 --> 57:27.280
something that's beyond asking him for stuff or to just simply solve a thing

57:27.280 --> 57:30.880
one of the things we get to do in prayer is actually to ask God to reveal

57:30.920 --> 57:36.680
something to us about us which means we're not asking we're just listening

57:36.680 --> 57:40.000
in effect here's what the psalmist writes in Psalm 139 these famous words

57:40.000 --> 57:47.000
search me God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if

57:47.000 --> 57:51.640
there is any offensive some translations have the word hurtful way in me and lead

57:51.640 --> 57:59.480
me in the way everlasting like there is some way through the anxiety to be led

57:59.480 --> 58:03.880
in an everlasting and eternal kind of life not just forever like someday far

58:03.880 --> 58:08.640
away but right now in the present to say it differently again another rhyming

58:08.640 --> 58:11.840
thing please buckle your seatbelt I apologize but you need this okay stay

58:11.840 --> 58:17.720
with me all healing whether it's like a medical like you broke your foot you

58:17.720 --> 58:22.360
got an ear infection you got a heart condition all healing begins with

58:22.360 --> 58:28.520
revealing we have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing

58:28.520 --> 58:32.960
so that it can be addressed this is part of the naming process right and

58:32.960 --> 58:36.320
it's scary because we have to see it for what it is so here's what I'm gonna do

58:36.320 --> 58:41.440
I'm gonna give you a prayer it is a two-word prayer you can practice it

58:41.440 --> 58:44.600
whenever you want however you want I'm gonna give you a rundown on how to do

58:44.600 --> 58:48.440
it right now in a second but it's a two-word prayer that requires some

58:48.440 --> 58:51.280
courage and it's different for a lot of you that maybe you haven't yet understood

58:51.280 --> 59:03.280
what prayer is and here's what it looks like you ready search me search me there's

59:03.280 --> 59:06.960
something that needs to be revealed to me that I can't find on my own to be

59:06.960 --> 59:11.280
named so that I can differentiate it from myself and I need God to reveal it

59:11.280 --> 59:17.160
in me with tenderness with care not with shame not with condemnation but with

59:17.160 --> 59:27.240
love that gets drawn out so that in mind let's pray I'm gonna give you a moment

59:27.240 --> 59:34.760
just as your eyes are closed to sit in the stillness of this if there is a

59:34.760 --> 59:40.400
contrast between the loudness and the voices of anxiety it must be stillness

59:40.400 --> 59:53.520
and silence Jesus search me

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:32.800
search me Jesus that I might find where there's friction

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:55.120
search me Jesus to uncover the lie the fiction that's undergirding that friction

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:20.120
when I can't name them what you name them my anxious thoughts Jesus

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:36.760
will you lead me in the way ever-lasting

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:53.440
Father would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you

01:01:53.440 --> 01:02:01.720
in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives would you hear

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:07.840
your name the name that rescues that breaks through into the darkness Jesus

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:16.120
Jesus it is in your name that we pray Jesus amen

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:40.120
please bring it all to be the storm surrounding me

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:53.600
let it break and your name still call us it is still the rage you need is still

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.480
every way

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:07.080
and your name Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:20.480
Jesus Jesus silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:27.480
Jesus Jesus

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:38.480
we call these bones to live and call these lungs to sing once again

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:48.480
I will praise Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

01:03:48.480 --> 01:04:02.480
Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:27.480
Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:43.480
you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus you make the darkness

01:04:43.480 --> 01:05:04.480
true Jesus Jesus you silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus

01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:12.480
would you do this would you just stand together one of the things that you probably heard me say

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:16.480
this before if you've been around which is when we're singing we're setting our collective

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.480
prayer to music that's all we're doing and there's some real power in the prayer of people

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.480
being uttered at the same time in the same place there's something that happens in that

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.480
and I don't know how to explain it I just know that it does and so all I want us to do

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:36.480
is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices to sing that one more time together

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.480
and I'll close out our time so would you lead us in that

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:57.480
we sing Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:09.480
you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus would you hold out your hands and would you just

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.480
receive this blessing where there is darkness that needs to tremble you can call in the name

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.480
of Jesus might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:29.480
and depression and loneliness and isolation may you have the courage to utter the phrase

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:36.480
this week to God search me and know my anxious thoughts see if there's a hurtful way inside

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:45.480
of me and lead me in the way everlasting whatever you're up against may you know may it be conferred

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:52.480
upon you the love of the Father the grace of the Son and the fellowship and comfort of

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:56.480
the Holy Spirit in Jesus name so good to be with you amen so great to be together we'll

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:57.480
see you guys later
