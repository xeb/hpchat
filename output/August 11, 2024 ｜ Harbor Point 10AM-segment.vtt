WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

00:30.000 --> 00:38.000
Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ. Come on, put those hands.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Let's sing.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
If you believe, won't you put them together?

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
By His blood, I have been severed.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
I believe in resurrection.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Let's sing all praise.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Hallelujah, yes I do.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Hallelujah, I believe in Him.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I believe in the hope of heaven.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
He's preparing the place for me.

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Far beyond my heart's imagine.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
Here's a bird and night I see.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
I believe that He's going.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
His return is to blame, it's bright.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
Light the altar, keep it burning.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
See the light, the rose of holy light, yeah.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
All praise to the Father.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
All praise to Christ the Son.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
All praise to the Holy Spirit.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Our God has overblown.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

02:53.000 --> 03:01.000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe, yeah.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
I believe in You, Lord, and I trust You.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
I believe in You, though I'll never be ashamed.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
How could I ever walk away?

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Will the Word have saved my life?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
No, I'll never.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Of the gospel of Jesus.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
How could I ever walk away?

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
From the Word who saves my life?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
No, I'll never.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
No, I'll never be ashamed.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
How could I ever walk away?

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
From the Word who saves my life?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No, I'll never.

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
All praise to the Father.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
All praise to Christ the Son.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
All praise to the Holy Spirit.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
Our God has overblown.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.000
The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
I believe in you.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
How can you believe in Jesus today?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Won't you give him some praise?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We serve a God that is more than able.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
abundantly, how baffled we can ask for things.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Continue on our worship and sing unto the Lord.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
We trust you to depend on the Lord.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
The Son.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
When did I start to forgive?

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
All of the great things you did.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
And when did I throw away my faith for Him?

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
In the gospel of love?

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
And how did I start to believe?

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
You were to fish and fall.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And why do I talk my sick?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
How can I forgive you?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
How can you believe in God?

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
You are more than able.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
You are more than able.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
Stay it again.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
You are more than able.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Oh, hear the people today,

06:12.000 --> 06:16.000
waiting loud.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You are more than able.

06:19.000 --> 06:26.000
So who art to deny what the Lord can do?

06:26.000 --> 06:56.000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
oh

07:26.000 --> 07:36.000
More than able to rely, to deny what the Lord can do

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Can't you imagine?

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
And all of the faith in the room, what the Lord can do

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
What the Lord can do

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, it's gonna happen

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Just like the way we make it through

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
It's gonna load

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's gonna load

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Can't you imagine?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Can't you imagine?

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
With all of the faith in the room

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
What the Lord can do

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
What the Lord can do

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And it's gonna happen

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
Just like the way we make it through

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
It's gonna load

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
It's gonna load

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Anything is possible

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
We declare it today

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Anything is possible

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
Anything is possible

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
Anything is possible

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Anything is possible

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They believe in you

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Anything is possible

08:47.000 --> 08:53.000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

08:58.000 --> 09:05.000
So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

09:05.000 --> 09:10.000
Yeah, it's easy for you

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
I believe in you

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
See, you are more than people

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Why don't you close your eyes and sing that

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
It's a place of faith to sing

09:23.000 --> 09:33.000
So you are more than people

09:33.000 --> 09:39.000
You are more than people

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
We trust you are

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
You are more than people

09:47.000 --> 09:56.000
Who am I to deny what the Lord can do

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
Yes, Jesus

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
What a God we serve

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
We're gonna sing a new song

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It's called You Keep Hope Alive

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
It's very easy

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
So I'm gonna teach you first

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
But it's all proclaiming the hope that is in Jesus

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Because we have hope in Him

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Hope to live for tomorrow

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Let's stand in this world

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Let's sing this

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Sing

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Day makes me darkest

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
But your light is greater

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You will light our way

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
God, you will light our way

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
And with evil it's rising

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
You're rising higher

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
With power to save

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
With power to save

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I'm gonna teach you

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You keep hope alive

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
You keep hope alive

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
From the beginning to when

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
Your word never fails

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
You keep hope alive

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Because you are alive

11:03.000 --> 11:09.000
Jesus, you are alive

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
Death had a strong hope

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
And your light is stronger

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
You're always strong

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
Liberator rose up from the red

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
Anybody believe it today

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
That the evil is rising

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
You're rising higher

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
With power to save

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
With power to save

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Come on, you got that

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Come on, let's show it all together

11:33.000 --> 11:37.000
You keep hope alive

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
You keep hope alive

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
From the beginning to when

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Your word never fails

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
You keep hope alive

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
Because you are alive

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
Jesus, you are alive

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
With power to save

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Death had a strong hope

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
And your light is stronger

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
You keep hope alive

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Because you're living hope

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Because you're breathing this hope

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
In the brave hope

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
In the silent hope

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
For this moment alone

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Once you're rising, there is hope

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Give the morning hope

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
In the evening this hope

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Because you're living hope

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
Because you're breathing this hope

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
In the brave hope

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
In the silent hope

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
For this moment alone

12:45.000 --> 12:48.000
For tomorrow

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
You keep hope alive

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
You keep hope alive

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
From the beginning to when

You keep hope alive

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Because you are alive

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000

You keep hope alive

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
You keep hope alive

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
From the beginning to when

You keep hope alive

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Because you are alive

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Jesus, you are alive

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
You keep hope alive

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
You keep hope alive

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
From the beginning to when

Your word never fails

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
You keep hope alive

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Because you are alive

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Jesus, you are alive

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
You're alive

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
You are alive

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Don't you rest in it

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I don't have to worry about a thing

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Because you're alive

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
You keep hope alive

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
You keep my hope alive

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
In the middle of the storm

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
You're standing right there with me

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
In the middle of the fog

14:41.000 --> 14:47.000
You keep hope alive

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Thank you, Lord

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
If my grandma was here and she wouldn't sing it like this

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
She would say, because she lives

14:57.000 --> 15:03.000
I can face tomorrow

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Because Jesus lives

15:07.000 --> 15:12.000
All of my fears, they're gone

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
Because I know

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
I know, I know

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
He holds you in His future

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
In life

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
It's worth living just

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
Because Jesus lives

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
It's an old song, old song

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
I'm 33, but I got an old soul

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
I love those songs, you know

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Can I say one more time, just receive it

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
Receive it, let it encourage your spirit

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Back in the black church, we just used to sing songs

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
When people get excited, because it was the truth

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
Because He lives

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Someone needs to hear that

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
I can face tomorrow

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Because Jesus lives

16:08.000 --> 16:14.000
All of my fears, they are gone

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
They are gone

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
Because I know

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
I know, I know

16:26.000 --> 16:34.000
He holds my future in

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
Life isn't worth

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I don't have to give up

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
It's worth living just

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Because you are my Savior

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
He lives

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
If you know He lives, that's right

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
Give the Lord some praise

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
My life is worth living because He lives

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Because Jesus lives

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm gonna leave that alone before I start running

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
Welcome to Harbor Point, how y'all doing?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
I know y'all wondering again

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
This man is shouting at me again

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Y'all black dude, you gotta get off the stage

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Y'all, hey, I love you too

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
I love you too

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
This is an amazing church, so glad

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
I'm singing with my sister Brittany

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Who is Kobe's wife

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And she's singing for the first time

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
In what, four or five years?

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
Jesus

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
We got the same alma mater in Ohio

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And when I got my first job out of college

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I was living with them in Houston, Texas

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And they let me live there like a little brother

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
For free, just trying to find my way

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
Somehow, I got myself out to California

17:47.000 --> 17:48.000
Because of Kobe

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
And it's cool, like in this moment

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
I've been singing here and there, here and now

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
We're getting to lead and love God together

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
Again, so I'm so grateful for both of you

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
Love you, Kobe, don't y'all love Kobe?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
I ain't gonna say nothing smart this time

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Alright, well, I love you too

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And why don't you tell some people around you

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I love you, and then you may have a seat

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Okay

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Hey everyone, thanks for joining us today

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
We're so glad you're here

18:33.000 --> 18:37.000
At Harbor Point, giving is more than just a financial transaction

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
It's part of our worship

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
It's a tangible expression of our devotion and gratitude to God

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Demonstrating that our hearts are centered on Him

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Each week, we bring our offerings as an expression of our commitment

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
To God's work in and through His Church

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
Whether this is your first time giving

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
Or you're continuing your giving

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
Please take a look at the various ways you can contribute

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Thank you for your generosity

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
We're thrilled to continue our summer series

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
At the Movies

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
This year, you can enjoy At the Movies at two locations

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
The Regency Theatre in San Juan on Sundays at 10 a.m.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And at Harbor Point for our regular weekend services

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And don't forget Encore

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
On Thursday nights at 6.30 p.m.

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
It's a fantastic opportunity to invite your friends, neighbors, and coworkers

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
If you've been a part of Harbor Point for a while

19:35.000 --> 19:40.000
You've heard us say that every good thing that we do is done through great volunteers

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
And that's you

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
When I think of some of the amazing volunteers

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I think of Travis and Tina

19:46.000 --> 19:50.000
Who served so faithfully on our worship team for Harbor Point's VBS

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
We're so grateful for how they gave their time and talents

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
To pour into the next generation

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
So, if you're already serving at Harbor Point

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
We would love to say thank you

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
Or if you're curious about what it might look like to step into serving

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
We want to invite you to our volunteer rally and lunch

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000

Men of Harbor Point Man Camp 2024 is just a few weeks away

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
This transformative retreat will offer a unique opportunity to step away

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
From the daily life and connect with God and other men in our community

20:35.000 --> 20:42.000
You'll experience powerful worship, inspiring messages, and build lasting friendships

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
Man Camp will take place at Forest Home from August 23rd to 25th

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
As summer comes to a close

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Student ministries will be holding their end of summer celebrations

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Over the next couple weeks

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
High school will be celebrating with a beach bonfire at Dohini on Thursday, August 15th

21:00.000 --> 21:07.000

We would love to see you in person for our at the movie series here at Harbor Point Campus

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
Or the Regency Theater

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
But we thank you so much for joining us online today for our series on anxiety called

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
A Back of Angry Beasts

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Alright, hey everybody, how's it going?

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
Yeah, you guys chose a 10 o'clock service, you love traffic, you feel like it's raining

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
We can get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
Like, how am I gonna put to test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
But to find a parking lot that's miserable and work my way out of it

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
And you did it, you found it, way to go

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
Glad you guys made it, those of you guys are in the tent, glad you guys made it

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
It is so good to be with you guys and for those of you guys who are online

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Of course, we say this every single week

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to be together

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Because the people of our church are amazing, and really you guys are

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm really grateful to be with you guys, so fun

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
If you're, and I know you had to drive today through a puddle

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And you made it, it's incredible, so great stuff happening, let's get right to it

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
We have a lot to cover as we talk about this

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff and I just want to make sure we're clear

22:25.000 --> 22:28.000
We do not have all the answers, this is not a church where we have everything figured out

22:28.000 --> 22:33.000
Here's what we know, we're looking at Jesus, we believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
And that requires everybody to help us along the way

22:36.000 --> 22:40.000
Everybody's got a next step in that, so whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus

22:40.000 --> 22:44.000
You're investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all together

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Who are work in progress kind of people doing that stuff

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
So, however that is, grateful that you're here, let's get right to it

22:53.000 --> 22:58.000
I want to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention as you watch this commercial

22:58.000 --> 23:02.000
Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
Okay, but, I recognize it, it's fine

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Check this out, okay, here we go

23:13.000 --> 23:18.000
Mary Clary thinks her zipper bags are the best, and will never switch to Gladlock zipper bags

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
That's right, never

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here, with either your bag filled with angry bees

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
Or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
See that green color chain seal there, Mayor? That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Your bag doesn't have a green seal

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
You know, change is good, I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Just kidding, Mayor

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
When it really counts, don't get mad, get Gladlock zipper bags

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay, some of you remember this commercial

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Now, what I want to, obviously it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over-analyzing it and taking it way too seriously

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Okay, that's the gift I bring

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But, let's look at this for a moment

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice

23:57.000 --> 24:01.000
Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which makes the green thing

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
Which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag

24:08.000 --> 24:13.000
Would you rather have hold the angry bees that we're going to give you

24:13.000 --> 24:19.000
And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed to do this

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea

24:24.000 --> 24:29.000
That these people who are making this scenario happen, not only have they got bees to give a person to hold

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
But also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
It's like an elevator that doesn't go anywhere, that's all that it is

24:40.000 --> 24:44.000
It's the same thing, you're talking on a phone but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which they're agreeing to do

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away, I don't want to do any of this

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
I don't care what bag you use, I'm not doing this, this whole thing is stupid

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her in this thing

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
The question is, and why are people saying yes to this

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
And the question, over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
The question is, well who's in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea?

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
And says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth, the whole thing is bizarre and absurd

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
And who's in charge here

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
Who's in charge here?

25:38.000 --> 25:42.000
We're in week two of a series called The Bag of Angry Bees and it's a series on anxiety

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
Because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
But I want to catch us up a little bit, if you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing fields

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
As we talk about this idea of anxiety

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
One of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
Fear is the response to something that has happened

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
Like bear, person with a knife coming after us, oh my gosh that's fear

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Anxiety is, what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
That's anxiety, are you with me? One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
And we said generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing that's happening

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
But in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level, are you with me?

26:27.000 --> 26:32.000
Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something in common

26:32.000 --> 26:37.000
Every single anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty

26:37.000 --> 26:41.000
It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
All of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current statistics on this

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
Which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have someone in your house perhaps

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Or you yourself as someone who has anxiety

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you grew up

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
What kind of healthy environment you might have encountered

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
Some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
The best solution is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Compensate by being high functioning

27:24.000 --> 27:27.000
And just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Because you shouldn't have to deal with it, just snap out of it

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told us

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
We were told, here's what you should do

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
And then by comparison, you won't care anymore

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people

27:45.000 --> 27:49.000
So I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either of the anxieties

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
In either case

27:50.000 --> 27:54.000
And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like

27:54.000 --> 27:57.000
You know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Who maybe they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
I'm suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
Don't be anxious about anything, thank you so much

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
And they're like, well, don't be anxious

28:11.000 --> 28:15.000
But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that

28:17.000 --> 28:23.000
I guess I'm not supposed to have this, because the solution to having anxieties apparently just don't

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal with it as a shame thing

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
Because I'm not supposed to have it, and so it never really gets dealt with at all

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level

28:36.000 --> 28:40.000
And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Who's in charge?

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in charge?

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
My feelings or my thoughts are in charge, I'm not in charge, not me, I'm not in charge

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
I'm freaking out here

28:55.000 --> 28:59.000
And this is where it starts, this is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue

28:59.000 --> 29:01.000
In other words, probably another way to say it is this

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
Anxiety has a double effect

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
To say it this way, I'm freaking out about freaking out

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And this is why people get stuck in it

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Like, what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
And you maybe have this experience, or do you know people who do

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
And here's what I want to do today

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I want to give us one tool

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
It's not the answer to everything, it doesn't solve all the anxiety

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool

29:36.000 --> 29:40.000
That also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
It's just gonna, and just again, to make sure we reiterate

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
I'm not an expert

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Someone told you were doing a series on anxiety

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure about Jesus

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
But I'll come here that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on this

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I'm not an expert, I'm not a therapist, this is not my degree

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I'm a fellow traveler in this

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I do a little bit of research on some stuff

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
But I also want to tell you this, fair warning

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
The way we're gonna get to this one tool is a very windy road

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes

30:20.000 --> 30:23.000
I don't appreciate the laughter

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
It's fine, it's fine

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
But you're gonna be like, what in the world are we doing?

30:28.000 --> 30:31.000
And then I promise I will bring it back home

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
But you're gonna wonder for a little bit

30:33.000 --> 30:36.000
Because I'm gonna start in a place you may not expect

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
And then we're gonna get there

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
So I'm gonna start in ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Because that's where you thought I was gonna go

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
Here's what we're gonna do, I'm totally serious

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
Ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
Here's what happens, it happens in six phases

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
This is the first of the phases, it starts like this

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It's the boundary making of a particular thing

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Here's where things are, here's where things are

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
This separates the sacred space from the not sacred space

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Boundary making

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filming

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
There's some filling of things and some further separation of things

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Which are separated from other spaces

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East

31:15.000 --> 31:18.000
And the sixth phase of the Temple construction

31:18.000 --> 31:21.000
Whatever it is, whatever god that's being worshipped there

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
You typically, it's placed within there on the sixth phase

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Sort of the creation of a temple

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
To give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Now, there are six days, there's a seven day creation

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
But there's a six day creation narrative in the Bible

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
So god created mankind in his own image

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
And the image of god, he created them male and female

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
He created them, this is the sixth day of creation

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
Now, let me pause right here for a second

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
What's being said by this, many scholars agree

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
That the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that yet

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
That's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
That the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god's temple

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
The entire thing, no temple could contain him

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
So the whole cosmos is his temple

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
And instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day

32:16.000 --> 32:20.000
It's a person, people become the representation of this god

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
In his temple, the whole cosmos

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
And fill the earth and subdue it some translations

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
And have dominion over it

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky

32:37.000 --> 32:43.000
And over every living creature that moves on the ground

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
So this, the people aren't just simply decoration

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
There's more there, they're blessed and they're told to multiply and have dominion

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
And the answer to the question, who's in charge of all of the created stuff?

32:54.000 --> 32:57.000
The answer is, people are

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation

33:02.000 --> 33:06.000
In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to

33:06.000 --> 33:11.000
Is god himself, other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
It's gift to Genesis chapter 2, where it gets a little bit more specific about some of this stuff

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
All the wild animals and all the birds of the sky

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
This created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Which now has this responsibility to name everything

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Again, this might be a challenge for some of you

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Like I'm not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what's happening here

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Because here's what's happening in naming

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this

33:53.000 --> 33:56.000
The first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing

33:56.000 --> 34:00.000
So when someone names a thing, it says this is a that and I'm not that

34:00.000 --> 34:05.000
That's not me, over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is from me

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's separate from me

34:07.000 --> 34:11.000
Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Does that make sense, this is differentiation, you're different than me

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
That's what's being said, when we name a thing

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Secondly what happens in naming is sort of an authority over

34:20.000 --> 34:25.000
Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not me

34:29.000 --> 34:33.000
But it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
The Old Testament, the Old Covenant

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
Part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Kind of conversation about names

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Not least of which is the name of God

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
Which is kind of if you read Moses' interaction with God

34:48.000 --> 34:51.000
In the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
But one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
What do I tell people your name is as if to say

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed

34:57.000 --> 35:00.000
It's so unbelievably important and sacred

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
In fact, to this day, you will find

35:02.000 --> 35:07.000
Very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
They'll refer to God as this word, Hashem

35:10.000 --> 35:15.000
Who in that word simply means the name

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
Like we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
Because it's so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
So the word simply to describe God is just the name

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Names are crucial

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
But you know this, even nicknaming has rules

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Maybe you still go by that nickname

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Maybe introduce yourself as a particular name

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
Maybe, you know, like, but there's some rules that go along with that

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
You know that there's rules about that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Now the first rule of nicknaming is

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
You don't get to choose your own nickname

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
You don't get to decide

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
Like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Now I'm going by MacGyver

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Kind of rhymes with McGuire

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
Plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And like a, you know, rubber band

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
And he could like, oh look, let's fly away and escape

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
Like a scuba tank, he could save the world

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
You know, I'm going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
That's not how it goes, you can't choose your nickname

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
You don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
And the way it always works is sort of a top-down method

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Either the leader, the group of a person is like

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
You're now this, or the group decides

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Hey, we've decided you're going by this nickname

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
You'll get to choose it, you can't declare it

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
It's what we've all decided because it's a top-down method

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's the way it's worked, it never gets to be the other way

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
It's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Ascribing a nickname to a person

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
And there's always, it tends to be, not always

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
But tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
That's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
A little bit funny, but it's based in truth

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
It always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
You know, so I can never figure out, even to this day

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
I can't figure out what the truth was

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
In there, I don't really know, that's weird

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Anyway, so anyway, where was I going?

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your own name

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
Right, you guys watch Seinfeld and you know, maybe you saw

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
The top-down method is how this works

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Remember this, this is going to matter in a second

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
And there's always an element of sort of truth and mockery

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
That kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
This man is what we would call demonized

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
He's possessed by a demon

37:24.000 --> 37:28.000
And what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
He doesn't have a house, he's all by himself

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
We have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Or, you know, demon possession

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
A couple of different things

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
One of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Anytime anybody had something, sort of some sort of mental illness

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
They would just naturally ascribe it to demon

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
That's a lot of demon, that's what that is

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
And I just want to say, you might be right

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
But I also want to just propose something else

37:58.000 --> 38:01.000
The Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
That is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular, ongoing basis

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
And sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that are happening

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
And I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic

38:13.000 --> 38:17.000
People who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
And yet there is still in the Bible this description of things

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
That where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do

38:25.000 --> 38:27.000
And here's what I just want to say

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
The one does not exclude the other

38:30.000 --> 38:34.000
There is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose back in the first century

38:34.000 --> 38:37.000
And there is also demonic activity that's also at work

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
So I just want to make sure we're all clear on that

38:39.000 --> 38:40.000
Are we okay moving forward with this?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Okay, good, here we go

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Now, here's the scene, Luke 8, 26

38:44.000 --> 38:48.000
They sailed to the regions of the Jeresians, which is across the lake from Galilee

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
This is in the northern part of Israel, there's two big lakes

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
There's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
The Dead Sea is way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee is much more important

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Because things live there

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
And on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other side

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
This is where people don't go very often

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
But when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
But had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
This is this person who lives by himself, naked in the tombs

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
And this man runs up to Jesus

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice

39:21.000 --> 39:22.000
What's important to keep in mind

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
When you see this, and the story is also in Mark 5

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
You can read this story, and one of the things that's crucial when you see it

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
Is there's always this really difficult distinction between

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
It's hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Who's talking here? Is the demon or is it the guy?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
What I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of keep it

39:39.000 --> 39:42.000
It's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
Now, when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
I beg you, don't torture me

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
So this is such an interesting kind of encounter

39:54.000 --> 39:59.000
Some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Is an attempt to gain control over Jesus

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
Which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know rule number two

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
It's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
This is what's going to be shown in a moment here

40:11.000 --> 40:16.000
But there's this sort of crying out of Jesus' name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Verse 29

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
This is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
Like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
So Luke is recording what happened

40:26.000 --> 40:30.000
He's like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Is because of this right here

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

40:34.000 --> 40:38.000
And many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
He had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
Let's pause here for a second

40:45.000 --> 40:51.000
So often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
So often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness

40:55.000 --> 40:58.000
It isn't that the man was like, oh man I feel like I got a thing

40:58.000 --> 40:59.000
I got a ghost

40:59.000 --> 41:06.000
It's that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Then Jesus asked him

41:09.000 --> 41:17.000
What is your name?

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him

41:20.000 --> 41:25.000
The word legion to talk about a Roman legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers

41:25.000 --> 41:33.000
So the idea of this means that there's a ton of demonic activity in this particular person

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
What is your name?

41:36.000 --> 41:39.000
The question that's being asked here is who's in charge

41:39.000 --> 41:45.000
Things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of the moment

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
And Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face of the whole idea here

41:51.000 --> 41:56.000
The demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know, he's able to like name him

41:56.000 --> 42:02.000
What's being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
And takes control of the moment

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
And then there's this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next

42:07.000 --> 42:11.000
Is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Which are nearby apparently

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
And then the pigs run into a lake and drown

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
That's the story, they're like, we're possessed!

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And they drown, that's it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
If you guys are wondering, that's what galloping pigs look like

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
And they run away and they drown

42:25.000 --> 42:30.000
Now, the question that you have, which is a fair question is

42:30.000 --> 42:35.000
What does this have to do with anybody's anxiety?

42:35.000 --> 42:40.000
Let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this

42:40.000 --> 42:45.000
One of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a linking and overlapping

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
Between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
And that person themselves, they make it their identity

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
It's one of the most tragic things that happens

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
One of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety journey

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
This is my wife, she said

42:59.000 --> 43:04.000
I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm always anxious, I'm anxious

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
She finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
This was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
Fusing the two things together

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Curtis Chang in his book, which I mentioned before

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
No, just kidding, but if you want to borrow it, it's fine

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
But we have a couple, his book's great, but here's one of the things he says to this very effect

43:32.000 --> 43:37.000
When we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended periods

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
I love the language

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
We identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these thoughts

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
The more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and over

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
We talked about this last week, about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
The more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
The more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
The more we become indistinguishable from that narrative

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
Such that we cannot abandon those thoughts

44:09.000 --> 44:17.000
And this mental fusion can be so complete, we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
In other words, when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
And it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating

44:31.000 --> 44:38.000
You can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
And find a way to rein it in

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
So here's what we need to do

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Name it

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
Name it

44:50.000 --> 44:55.000
We have to call the thing, whatever the thing is, we have to call it what it is

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
So that we can separate it from ourselves

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Here's what Curtis Chang says once again

45:00.000 --> 45:05.000
When we can name our thoughts, we recognize them as distinct from us

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Differentiation

45:07.000 --> 45:12.000
We're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in our minds

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
But they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation

45:16.000 --> 45:26.000
There's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
When I named my anxious thoughts, he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
The more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
The more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
The more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement

45:41.000 --> 45:51.000
And the more I said, oh, I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded away

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
So let's call it what it is, we've got to name it

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Got to name it

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
And the question you have, which is a fair question, is how do I name it?

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do with it?

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
And I just want to tell you, again, we're just going to look at kind of, this is the very beginning stages of stuff

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
But let's just talk about this for a moment

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
One of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in your life

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
Where are things not going smoothly? Where's their friction?

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
In other words, take it a different way

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
Can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated, afraid, etc.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
Where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing?

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
For instance, if you're going through Del Taco and you're like, they gave you the wrong hot sauce

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
And you're like, that's a bummer, they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
And they gave me regular old lame hot sauce

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
And you're like, that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
If you're like, they didn't give me del scorcho, I'm burning the place down

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
By the way, that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
Okay, but I'm just saying that there's a moment where you're like, my response should be a two, but it feels like it's a twelve

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
This is probably where you're going, maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to figure out what's going on here

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
There's a pattern where I'm overreacting, it should be a two and I'm giving it a twelve out of ten

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
Something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for all of us

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And they're all different kinds of scales

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
For me, confession, okay

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
I have to be very, very careful

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children

47:31.000 --> 47:35.000
Because there's a part of me, and I've told you guys this before, if you're with us last week, I said

47:35.000 --> 47:41.000
The thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been chasing me is this right here

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Being a disappointment and being irrelevant, these are the things that come up with

47:43.000 --> 47:47.000
Now, in a competition, anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Not just lose, but be a loser

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
It's right into this stuff

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
So, I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
Which is really, I have to measure, and some things I can't do

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
Whether it's like, doing things that's like an activity we do together, like surfing

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
It's like, my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
But I'm like, you know, I just, I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as they are

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
They're in there, like, my oldest is twenty

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
He lives, like, it goes to school right next to the beach

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
He surfs constantly, he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
I'm like, what is wrong with the world?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Anyway, but he does that, he's awesome

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
And my other kids are incredible, all the things they do

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
And I'm like, I'm out, and it's like, I'm making it a competition and I have to win

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
We're playing cards, we're playing horse, and how much does it matter if I'm like

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
Playing horse with my son, how important is it that I win?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Crucial is the answer to that question

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
But it should be a two, and it's a twelve, why does it matter?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
I have to be very careful with these things

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
Where's their friction, name it, you have to find some of the friction

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
It's probably one of the most helpful things you can do

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
But there's another layer to this, and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
And it's nonetheless crucial, and by the way, I have to apologize in advance

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
Before I give you this, I'm going to show you it in a second

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
It rhymes, okay?

49:00.000 --> 49:03.000
And I always am afraid when it rhymes, like, oh gosh

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
We just packaged this up in a little neat little thing

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And there's probably a little tiny little, if you look closely

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
A little TM on the top right of the circle around it, like trademark

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
There's nothing, I just want to make sure, I want you to make sure you remember it

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
But for those of you guys that have a high, like really sensitive cheese meter

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
This is going to set you off, okay?

49:18.000 --> 49:21.000
It's very cheesy, but it's really crucial, okay?

49:21.000 --> 49:24.000
So bear with me, okay? You guys ready for that?

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
I think you can handle this, okay?

49:26.000 --> 49:29.000
So not only are we finding the friction, where is there this ongoing sort of pattern

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Where I'm overreacting to certain things

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
But bear with me, probably what is more crucial than that

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
Is to find the fiction behind the friction

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
I do not appreciate that, sir

49:41.000 --> 49:51.000
Because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
Behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
Like, wow, that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular thing

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
And the thing that people, it may not be you, but people that are around you

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
That might suffer from anxiety, they're believing a particular lie

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
That's being rehearsed over and over again in their head

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
And it's nearly perfect, and the question we have to ask

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
Which is a very courageous question, which may require actual therapy

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
You might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff

50:17.000 --> 50:21.000
But the point is, there is 99%

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
I'm going to go 100%, okay?

50:23.000 --> 50:27.000
There's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
There is a perfect lie behind it

50:29.000 --> 50:36.000
And to ask the question, where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Behind the anxiety is a particular lie

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
I've showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down, and it's a lie

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Let me give you some things to think about

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
If you're having trouble kind of identifying it, this is not going to answer every question

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
But maybe some of these you might connect with, okay?

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Here

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
If blank happens, it means I've lost control

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
And when I lose control, the whole world goes at just whatever

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
I have to be in control

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And if something happens, it means I've lost control

50:59.000 --> 51:03.000
It could be any number of things for you, it can be small, and it can be big

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
It can be I'm late for dropping my kids off for school, I'm late for picking my...

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
It could be I'm late for school, it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
It could be if I don't connect with these people, if I mess up my own

51:15.000 --> 51:19.000
If I don't get on Instagram enough times, or I don't see these things, it means I've lost control

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
Some of you might have this scenario, there won't be enough

51:24.000 --> 51:27.000
I know what will happen, there's just not going to be enough blank

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Filling whatever you want there

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
Money, attention, affection, love

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
I know that if I say yes to this now, then there won't be enough later

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
Or if this person says yes to this in my life

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
There's only a certain, there's like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
And if they take a slice, it's going to be one less thing available for me, or for anybody else

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Or just won't be enough of whatever it is

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
You can, maybe that's you

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
Some of you have this, if I can't blank well, whatever it is

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
I'll be alone

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
If I can't do well as a student, if I don't perform well at my job

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
If I'm not a good friend, if I don't appear wonderful, if I don't do beauty well

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
If I don't do personal health and fitness well

52:06.000 --> 52:11.000
If I don't do living the California life well, then I'll be all alone and people won't want me

52:13.000 --> 52:16.000
That may be you

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
Some people have this one, it just connects with a lot of people

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
Things are going so great, but now what?

52:22.000 --> 52:28.000
Like I know everything's awesome, but that only means there's an impending doom right around the corner

52:28.000 --> 52:31.000
I feel like things are going great, my friendships are great

52:31.000 --> 52:34.000
Maybe you're single and you've got all your crew of friends, you're like, we're getting along great

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
And we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
It's all going to go, something's going to happen immediately

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Maybe you're a person who's got a mom group and you're all hanging out

52:43.000 --> 52:46.000
Things are incredible, you've got your kids and your marriages are incredible

52:46.000 --> 52:49.000
And you're like, it's a matter of time before everything goes away

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
There's going to be disease, there's going to be a volcano, there's going to be something that swallows us up

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
We're all going to die, I just know it

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
There'll be a puddle on the way to church, I mean, you never know

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
A lot of people have this, things are going great, but they can't forever

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
Just waiting for the house of cards to fall

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
That's an anxiety

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
Some people have this, that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
However, I try to communicate who I am, I'll never be fully understood

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Which is a matter of being not loved and being alone

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Once again, I just cannot be an understood person

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
And this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Some people have this

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
What if I or we never get through blank?

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
We're a tough patch in our marriage

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
I want to meet Mr. Wright, I want to meet Mrs. Wright

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I want to be around these people

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
But I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
What if we never get through it?

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
What if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness, I never get through it?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.000
What if that never happens?

53:45.000 --> 53:49.000
I'm just preparing myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
So what if I never get through it?

53:54.000 --> 53:59.000
All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we're worried about

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
And they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And for some of you, it may not be you

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
Like I said, you may not be the person who's got anxiety

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
You may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff

54:08.000 --> 54:14.000
But you probably live with people and you're like, why are they reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2?

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
Because there's probably a fiction behind it that's generating that sort of thing

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Now, what do we do with that?

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
Now, this is really important

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
What we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus

54:30.000 --> 54:35.000
Some of you are like, look, I'm okay with Jesus that came because you're talking about anxiety and some cool stuff

54:35.000 --> 54:39.000
But I just want to tell you, there's a dimension that we're going to talk about here

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Which is so important to understanding what it is to walk with Jesus

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Because there's a spiritual dimension to faith

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
It is not just practical help for all these kinds of things

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
You go to lots of places to get that

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
And we're okay with that, by the way

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
We're a church, we're kind of okay with Jesus

54:52.000 --> 54:55.000
But I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
That's going to push this a little further

54:57.000 --> 55:01.000
And I think it's probably, for some of you, maybe like an invitation to step into something you've not yet considered

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
But here's what I want to do

55:03.000 --> 55:06.000
Remember, when you look back at the story of Jesus with this demonized person

55:06.000 --> 55:09.000
This man who's naked in the tombs

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
It's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Jesus doesn't need the name to be able to take control, which is really important to keep in mind

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
But Jesus extracts the name of the demon, the demon says his own name, Legion

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
The guy doesn't do it

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
The demon's the one who drove him into isolation

55:23.000 --> 55:26.000
He's the demon, he's the naked demon guy living in the tombs

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
Doesn't live at home anymore

55:27.000 --> 55:30.000
And even the guy couldn't name the thing

55:30.000 --> 55:33.000
Jesus has to draw it out of this person

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff

55:35.000 --> 55:38.000
You actually need some supernatural assistance to do it

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
You actually need this

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
This is what Jesus really can do

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
And the inner stuff, all this stuff, it's hard

55:44.000 --> 55:47.000
It requires courage and humility

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
And this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
Let's go back to Philippians 4, 6 and 7

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Do not be anxious about anything

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
Present your request to God

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
And the peace of God which transcends all understanding

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
What's so crucial to keep in mind is

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Every anxious person loves the second part of that

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
The peace of God which transcends understanding

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
We all want that

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Even if you're not an anxious person, you're like, that sounds great

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
The peace of God which is beyond even my own understanding

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
I want that

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
But what I want to do today is this

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
During everything in mind

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I want to focus on this part of that verse

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
Prayer and petition

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
When most of us think about prayer

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
We think about petition

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Which is asking for a particular thing

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Petition means I'm asking for a particular thing

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
The language of petition is in the First Amendment

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
The right to petition the government is part of what's in there

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Like that actually gets to ask for a particular thing

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
To make something, to make a request, a formal request of a thing

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Which is part of what's being described here

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
In fact, even it says, make your request known to God

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
But there's also something else there

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
It says prayer and petition

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Which they're under the same umbrella

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But there's something different about the two things

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Which is worth thinking about

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Because for a lot of us, all we think about is prayer

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Is while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
And I'm ready for a couple different answers

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
You know, like maybe you heard that growing up

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It's like, yes, you can have what you want, no you can't

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Or you just have to wait around a little while

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
It's like, that's all we know about prayer

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
I don't want to say that there's a beautiful part to that

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
But I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Because maybe in prayer what we get to do

57:21.000 --> 57:26.000
Is to seek God to do something that's beyond asking him for stuff

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Or to just simply solve a thing

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
One of the things we get to do in prayer

57:30.000 --> 57:35.000
Is actually to ask God to reveal something to us, about us

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Which means we're not asking, we're just listening in effect

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Here's what the Psalmist writes in Psalm 139

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
These famous words, search me God and know my heart

57:42.000 --> 57:46.000
Test me and know my anxious thoughts

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
See if there is any offensive

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
Some translations have the word hurtful way in me

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
And lead me in the way everlasting

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
Like there is some way through the anxiety

57:59.000 --> 58:02.000
To be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Not just forever, like someday far away

58:04.000 --> 58:07.000
But right now in the present

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
To say it differently, again, another rhyming thing

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Please buckle your seatbelt, I apologize

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Please read this, okay, stay with me

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
All healing, whether it's like a medical

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
Like you broke your foot, you got an ear infection

58:19.000 --> 58:25.000
You got a heart condition, all healing begins with revealing

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
We have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing

58:28.000 --> 58:31.000
So that it can be addressed

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
This is part of the naming process, right

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
And it's scary because we have to see it for what it is

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to give you a prayer

58:39.000 --> 58:42.000
It is a two-word prayer, you can practice it whenever you want

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
However you want, I'm going to give you a rundown

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
On how to do it right now in a second

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
But it's a two-word prayer that requires some courage

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
And it's different for a lot of you than maybe you haven't yet understood what prayer is

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
And here's what it looks like, you ready?

58:55.000 --> 58:59.000
Search me

58:59.000 --> 59:02.000
Search me

59:02.000 --> 59:05.000
There's something that needs to be revealed to me

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
That I can't find on my own to be named

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
So that I can differentiate it from myself

59:09.000 --> 59:12.000
And I need God to reveal it in me

59:12.000 --> 59:15.000
With tenderness, with care, not with shame

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
Not with condemnation, but with love

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
That gets drawn out

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
So, that in mind

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
Let's pray

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
I'm going to give you a moment, just as your eyes are closed

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
To sit in the stillness of this

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
If there is a contrast between the loudness

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
And the voices of anxiety, it must be stillness

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
And silence

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
Jesus

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
Search me

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Search me

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Jesus that I might find where there's friction

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Search me, Jesus, that I might find where there's friction.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Search me, Jesus, to uncover the lie, the fiction that's undergirding that friction.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:20.000
When I can't name them, will you name them, my anxious thoughts, Jesus?

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Will you lead me in the way everlasting?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Father, would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Would you hear your name?

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000
The name that rescues, that breaks through into the darkness, Jesus.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Jesus.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
It is in your name that we pray, Jesus.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Amen.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Let it break, and your name still, call the seed of still, the rage and need of still, every way.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000
And your name, Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:28.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:39.000
We call these bones to live, and call these lungs to sing once again.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I will praise Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:53.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:21.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:37.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:04.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Would you do this? Would you just stand together?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:18.000
One of the things that, you probably heard me say this before, if you've been around, which is when we're singing, we're setting our collective prayer to music.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
That's all we're doing.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
And there's some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same time, in the same place.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
There's something that happens in that, and I don't know how to explain it, I just know that it does.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:37.000
And so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices, to sing that one more time together, and then I'll close out our time.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
So would you lead us in that?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
We sing Jesus, Jesus.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:51.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:58.000
You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:08.000
You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Where there is darkness that needs to tremble, you can call in the name of Jesus.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety and depression and loneliness and isolation?

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:35.000
May you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God, search me and know my anxious thoughts.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:42.000
See if there's a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Whatever you're up against, may you know, may it be conferred upon you the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So good to be with you. Amen.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So great to be together. We'll see you guys later.
