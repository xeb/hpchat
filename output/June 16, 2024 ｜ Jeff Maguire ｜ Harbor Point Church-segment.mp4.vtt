00:30.000 --> 00:47.000
 Let's all stand together and sing to our King who fights our battles for us, he's victorious,

00:47.000 --> 00:56.000
 he's the Lord of Lords, let's worship him today, let's sing together.

00:56.000 --> 01:07.000
 When all I see is the battle, you see my victory.

01:07.000 --> 01:16.000
 When all I see is the bout, you see about him.

01:16.000 --> 01:28.000
 And as I walk through the shadows, your love surrounds me.

01:28.000 --> 01:38.000
 There's nothing to fear now, for I am safe with you.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
 I know when I'll fly out, but I know my knees with my heads lifted high.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
 And everything I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night.

01:57.000 --> 02:08.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

02:08.000 --> 02:20.000
 And if you were for me, who could be against me?

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
 For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you.

02:28.000 --> 02:40.000
 When all I see of the ashes, you see the beauty.

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
 When all I see is the cross, but you see every day.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
 So when I'll fly out, fight on my knees with my heads lifted high.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

03:02.000 --> 03:10.000
 Every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
 And Almighty for our trust, you go before us.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
 You shine in the shadow, you win every battle.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
 Almighty for our trust, you go before us.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
 You shine in the shadow, you win every battle.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
 Almighty for our trust, you go before us.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
 You shine in the shadow, you win every battle.

04:23.000 --> 04:32.000
 Nothing can stand against the power of our God.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
 So when I'll fly out, fight on my knees with my head lifted high.

04:40.000 --> 04:48.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
 Every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

04:58.000 --> 05:25.000
 Oh God, the battle belongs to you.

05:25.000 --> 05:35.000
 Oh you are holiness, oh we bring you faith.

05:35.000 --> 05:41.000
 A thousand generations, falling down and worship,

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
 sing the song of ages through the night.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.000
 It's all with God before us, it's all we'll believe.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
 We'll sing the song of ages through the night.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
 Your name, your name is the highest.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
 Your name is the greatest.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
 Your name stands above the law.

06:15.000 --> 06:21.000
 Your pros and dominions on house and positions.

06:21.000 --> 06:26.000
 Your name stands above the law.

06:26.000 --> 06:36.000
 And the angels cry, holy, our creation cries.

06:36.000 --> 06:46.000
 Holy, you are lifted high.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
 Holy, only forever.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
 If you've been forgiven, if you've been redeemed,

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
 sing the song forever through the night.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
 And if you walk in free, and if you bear His name,

07:15.000 --> 07:21.000
 sing the song forever through the night.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
 You'll sing the song forever as it may,

07:26.000 --> 07:36.000
 and the angels cry, holy, our creation cries.

07:36.000 --> 07:43.000
 Holy, you are lifted high.

07:43.000 --> 07:53.000
 Holy, only forever.

07:53.000 --> 08:03.000
 Your people sing, holy, to the King of kings.

08:03.000 --> 08:19.000
 Holy, you will always be, holy, holy forever.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
 Your name, your name is the highest.

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
 Your name is the greatest.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
 Your name stands above the law.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
 Your pros and dominions on house and positions.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
 Your name stands above the law.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
 Your name is the highest.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
 Your name is the greatest.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
 Your name stands above the law.

09:01.000 --> 09:08.000
 Your pros and dominions on house and positions.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
 Your name stands above the law.

09:13.000 --> 09:23.000
 And the angels cry, holy, our creation cries.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
 Holy, you are lifted high.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
 Holy, only forever.

09:37.000 --> 09:50.000
 Your people sing, holy, to the King of kings.

09:50.000 --> 10:06.000
 Holy, you will always be, holy, holy forever.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.000
 And you will always be, holy, holy forever.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
 You are holy and so holy.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
 Amen. Well, we can sing that song with confidence,

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
 knowing that God is holy, holy forever,

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
 that His name will last forever, that He is set apart.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
 The description in the book of Revelation is

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
 that the angels bow down and worship Him

10:41.000 --> 10:46.000
 and they say, holy, holy, holy.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
 Yet He's a God that cares about us,

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
 that's involved in our lives,

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
 that knows the individual aspects of what we're going through

10:55.000 --> 11:00.000
 and wants to help us grow and transform us

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
 into the person that He wants us to be.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
 We got to celebrate this last night

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
 as we had our rooted graduates here.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
 They ended their 10 week experience and celebrated them

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
 and we saw the transformation.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
 We heard stories and story after story of people

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
 that said, I signed up for this

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
 and I was hoping for this and God did this.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
 The individual transformation that takes place in each life

11:25.000 --> 11:29.000
 is because of a God that is holy.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
 It's also because of a people that have said

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
 we're going to be generous in our response

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
 to what God is doing and we're going to jump in

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
 in any way that we feel led.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
 It's your generosity and your worship

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
 and your offering that you have brought

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
 that allows things like rooted to take place.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
 For those of you that are in life groups,

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
 you know that rooted is the first 10 weeks of a life group

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
 and you get connected to your church

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
 and the people around you and God

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
 and learn more about yourself.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
 We get to see that transformation take place

11:59.000 --> 12:03.000
 because of the generosity here at Harbor Point.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
 If you want to jump in and participate in that,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
 there's ways on the screens behind me

12:08.000 --> 12:14.000
 that you can jump in and play a part in that generosity.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
 I want you to see in just a minute on the screens behind me,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
 you're going to watch cardboard testimonies.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
 If you know about rooted,

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
 cardboard testimony is a chance to look back

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
 on where we were 10 weeks ago.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
 What we were is that person

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
 and what we're experiencing going through

12:31.000 --> 12:35.000
 and how we've been transformed and changed by God,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
 a holy God that cares about us today.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
 So you're going to see that in the next song in just a little bit.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
 Would you pray with me as we continue in our service?

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
 Father, we thank you.

12:46.000 --> 12:50.000
 We thank you, God, that you are holy.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
 We sing, we raise our hands,

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
 we proclaim that truth through song today,

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
 knowing that you are holy and you care about us.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
 You want to transform our lives

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
 because you have a picture of who we can be.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
 And Lord, you're engaged and in our lives

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
 and we praise you for that.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
 Father, we respond and are offering now

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
 as a worship to you.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
 And God, we give it to you because we know

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
 that you can take it and use it

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
 to continue to transform more and more lives.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
 We thank you for who you are.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
 We ask that you be with us now

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
 and shape us and form us

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
 as we continue in our service and worship today.

13:39.000 --> 13:55.000
 Senior Sons, let me pray. Amen.

13:55.000 --> 14:10.000
 And out of the wilderness, into your little neighborhoods,

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
 all look where I'm standing now.

14:16.000 --> 14:26.000
 Yes, look where I'm standing now.

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
 I stand on shame breaking, miracle making,

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
 the powerful name of Jesus.

14:36.000 --> 14:49.000
 On the body raised, prodigal saved, powerful name of Jesus.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
 Jesus.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
 Left by your mighty hand, into the promised land.

15:03.000 --> 15:09.000
 Look where I'm standing now.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
 You carried the cross for me.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
 Now I am a child of the King.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
 Oh, look where I'm standing now.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
 Look where I'm standing now.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
 I stand on shame breaking, miracle making,

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
 the powerful name of Jesus.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
 On the body raised, prodigal saved,

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
 powerful name of Jesus.

15:47.000 --> 16:16.000
 Oh.

16:30.000 --> 16:46.000
 Oh.

16:46.000 --> 16:56.000
 Oh.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
 Jesus must say the rescue me.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
 Jesus must say the rescue me.

17:24.000 --> 17:29.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
 Jesus must say the rescue me.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
 Hallelujah, Jesus must say the rescue me.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

17:57.000 --> 18:03.000
 I stand on shame breaking, miracle making,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
 the powerful name of Jesus.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
 On the body raised, prodigal saved,

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
 powerful name of Jesus.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
 I stand on the shame breaking, miracle making,

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
 the powerful name of Jesus.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
 On the body raised, prodigal saved,

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
 powerful name of Jesus.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
 Oh, Hallelujah, I'm free.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
 Hallelujah, Jesus must say the rescue me.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

18:52.000 --> 19:03.000
 Hallelujah, Jesus must say the rescue me.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
 Hallelujah, I'm free.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
 Hallelujah.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
 Oh, Hallelujah.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
 Give him praise.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
 Oh, come on, if you are free, if you've been set free,

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
 lift up a shout of praise unto Jesus this morning in bed.

19:22.000 --> 19:29.000
 Hallelujah, Hallelujah.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
 So good, so good to worship together.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
 Welcome to Harbor Point.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
 There are so many dads throughout the room.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
 Happy Father's Day to you all.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
 Beautiful people all throughout the room.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
 Why don't you turn to your neighbor,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
 give somebody a high five.

19:41.000 --> 19:49.000
 You can grab a seat.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
 Oh, wow, you're taking this serious.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
 The whole thing's about being serious.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
 Apparently you're not ready to be serious.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
 Let me lower this so you can hear my joke appropriately.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
 I can hear.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
 Okay.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
 All right, I'm going to put my down a little bit.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
 Is that your first joke?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
 That was it.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
 Look at it.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
 Okay.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
 All right.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
 I got to get in the zone.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
 Like I said, I'm not at a disadvantage.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
 I laugh at my own jokes, but I'm competitive.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
 So the two things are going head to head here.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
 Give me your worst.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
 Look at me.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
 Oh, I'm right here.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
 I am right here and you're right here.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
 Okay, how am I going to do this one?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
 We're crossing our eyes.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
 Yes.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
 Elevating the humor level to the next.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
 When I cross my eyes, I can't remember my joke.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
 Okay, I remember now.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
 After you read it, you remembered it.

20:37.000 --> 20:45.000
 Did I get a point there?

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
 What did one eye say to the other eye?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
 I don't know.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
 There's something between us that smells.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
 Does it quiver?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
 Count.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
 He's quivering.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
 Quivering too.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
 You're quivering.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
 Okay.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
 Oh, that's a laugh.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
 It's a wash.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.000
 Okay.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
 Let's see here.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
 I'm reading a horror story in Braille.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
 How are you?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
 Yeah.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
 Something bad is going to happen.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
 I can feel it.

21:14.000 --> 21:26.000
 Thank you for moving that.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
 Now I can see your face.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
 What do you call a paper airplane?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
 I can't fly.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
 I do not know.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
 Ready?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
 Stationary.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
 Do you have a bad morning?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
 What's going on?

21:41.000 --> 21:48.000
 I'll tell you, the morning would be great if I heard some humor around here, but apparently,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
 that's not what we're doing.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
 I went to buy some camouflage pants the other day.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
 Okay.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
 I couldn't find any.

21:54.000 --> 22:02.000
 Stop throwing stuff at me.

22:02.000 --> 22:11.000
 I asked the librarian if the library had any books on paranoia and she leaned in and

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
 whispered, they're right behind you.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
 Dang it.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
 That's two points for you that I've lost on my own joke.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
 Yeah.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
 This is easy.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
 This is easy.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
 At this point, because you can't resist this right here, if you feel like someone is watching

22:29.000 --> 22:39.000
 you, you're not alone.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
 Dude, that was probably for you.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
 What did Mario say to Princess Peach when he dumped her?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
 Mario.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
 It's not you.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
 It's a me, Mario.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
 No, come on.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
 I have so many more.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
 What's the difference between curtains and toilet paper?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
 I don't know.

23:07.000 --> 23:13.000
 So it was you?

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
 No, that's it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.000
 That's it.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
 That's it.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
 I'm done.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
 I'm happy to go out on that one.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
 All right.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
 Top shelf humor for you guys that are new with us every week.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
 We do that kind of stuff.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
 We just set the bar.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.000
 I know it's incredible.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
 Great to be with you guys.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
 Happy Father's Day.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
 It is Father's Day.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
 In case you didn't know, happy Father's Day.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
 Okay.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
 I just want to say, I don't want to compare days for parents here, but if we did that

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
 on Mother's Day, it would have been like a wave.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
 So I just want to say one more time, happy Father's Day.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
 Yeah.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
 Right.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
 Exactly.

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
 So in all seriousness, this is my 20th Father's Day, which is really bizarre to think about.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
 And you're just like, wow, I didn't know he was that old.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
 Yeah, now you know.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
 But yeah, my 20th Father's Day.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
 And in all seriousness, I just want to tell you, and this is really, really crucial, you

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
 guys, dads matter.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
 Dads matter.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
 The church and the world needs fathers and grandfathers, and it needs fathers and father

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
 figures, and so it matters.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
 And if you're wondering if you're doing a great job, you'll probably never know if you're

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
 doing a great job.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
 But let me just say, if you're showing up, that's half of it.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.000
 The rest of it you can figure out.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
 Just showing up is half of it.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
 And so I'm grateful for you guys.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
 Keep being dads and grandfathers and father figures to so many people.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
 We need you guys.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
 All right.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
 Cool.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
 Good.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
 Yeah.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
 All right.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
 If you're new with us, my name is Jeff.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
 I'm one of the pastors here.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
 I want to tell you as if you're new, again, I know there's a lot of places you could be.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
 There's like brunch plans you had.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
 There was, you know, all kinds of stuff you were planning on doing today.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
 And your dad was like, we're going to church.

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
 And it was like, oh, I got to go, I guess, or something like that.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
 Or maybe you were coerced or brought or tricked or however bribed you, however you wound up

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
 here.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
 I want to let you know that my favorite thing about our church is the people you're sitting

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
 around.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
 There's a lot of great stuff that happens on this stage.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.000
 But the best stuff that happens in our church is always with the people that you're sitting

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
 around.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
 And people will tell me over and over again, their favorite thing is the people they met.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
 They'll say, I'm like, did you not, there's something else going on the stage here?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
 Like, yeah, yeah, that was fine.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
 They were great.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
 They just seemed like a place where I could come and show up and kind of, you know, be

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
 myself and all that, all that sort of stuff.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
 And I just want to say, that's so true.

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
 In fact, you're sitting around a group of people who are incredibly generous.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
 And as we kind of like wind down our fiscal year, which ends at the end of June, you know,

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
 as we look at what that looks like, I just want to say we've done, gosh, you guys have

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
 enabled us to do so many incredible things.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
 And as we look forward to the future, I just want to make sure you're clear.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
 And I just, you know, from my own heart to you guys, A, that I'm incredibly grateful.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
 B, if you're a person who's like, hearing us talk about generosity, you're like, yeah,

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
 they talk about it all the time.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
 It's like, we're not ashamed of it.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.000
 The Bible isn't ashamed of it.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
 Jesus isn't ashamed of it.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
 So we talk about it.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
 And we have a belief about generosity that it's transformative.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
 And so if you're a person who's like, look, I'm all, I'm all, I'm okay with being generous.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
 I just don't want to give to the church.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
 I don't really, I don't know if I trust you guys at all.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
 It's okay.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
 Here, take my kids for an hour, but you can't have and I don't, but I don't trust you.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
 Yeah.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
 I get there's a little, that's fine.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
 But I just want to say, in all seriousness, if you're a person who's like, maybe you got

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
 wounded by a church in the past, some sort of financial thing, you know, some pastor

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
 absconded with some money or did something weird or whatever with, I just want to say,

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
 I get that it's really, it's difficult.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
 And you worked hard to whatever this is that you've earned, you worked hard to get that.

26:22.000 --> 26:26.000
 And I just want to say, if you're a person who's like, I can't give to the church because

26:26.000 --> 26:29.000
 I don't, I don't really trust what you guys do with this or whatever, you know, like I

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
 don't trust it.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
 Don't let that be a reason why you're not generous at all.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
 In other words, I have such a high, I believe that the Bible is pretty clear.

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
 We should be a part of what God's doing in the local church community, but if you can't

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
 for whatever reason, don't let that be a reason why you can't be generous somewhere else.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
 And to the degree that it's sacrificially, joyfully generous somewhere else.

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
 Find somewhere else that's making an eternal difference in the world and give sacrificially

26:52.000 --> 26:56.000
 to it because there are some things that God can only do when we're with our generosity,

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
 with our sacrificial generosity.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
 You want to join the generosity journey here?

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
 Great.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
 If you don't, don't let that be a reason not be generous period.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
 Find a way to be generous.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
 Everybody cool?

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
 Does that make sense?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
 All right.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
 We on board with that?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
 Okay.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
 Cool.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
 Yeah.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
 We're a little more tepid on that.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
 Not quite as excited about that.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
 Okay.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
 That's right.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
 That's right.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
 I want to let you guys know, by the way, you're looking at our incredible horse trough right

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
 here behind us.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
 It is, we're going to do some baptisms a little bit later.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
 I'm going to explain what that is.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
 If you're wondering about that, some of you came here like, I'm not sure what about baptism

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
 is.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
 That's a weird thing.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
 These Christian people do.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
 You're going to see it.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
 And some of you might be like, I should do that.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
 By the way, it's not like an oil change.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
 You have to do every 3,000 miles and like, well, I haven't done it in a while.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
 I guess I should do it again.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
 You only need to do it once, you know, but whatever.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
 But anyway, let me just see.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
 The water is nice and tepid.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
 And so that's wonderful.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
 And no one will burn themselves.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
 And it's not cold.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
 Okay.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
 A lot to get through.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
 Here we go.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
 I have to zoom through this message.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000
 We're in the middle of a series.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
 Let's start right here.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.000
 I'm going to ruin everybody.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
 Be really quiet.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
 I want you to hear something.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
 When you know the name of this song, if you know it, just raise your hand.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
 Don't shout it, but just name it.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
 You know the name of it.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
 Okay.

27:55.000 --> 28:04.000
 So, listen.

28:04.000 --> 28:10.000
 You get credit.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
 I'll call on you in a second.

28:14.000 --> 28:20.000
 Listen to this melody.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
 Jump to the next one.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
 This song is 15 minutes long.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
 I'm only going to show you a little chunk of it.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
 Okay.

28:26.000 --> 28:35.000
 But notice how it builds.

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
 Stay with it.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
 Once you get the melody, you can hum it.

28:41.000 --> 28:54.000
 Jump to the next one.

28:54.000 --> 29:03.000
 There you go.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
 Jump to the next one.

29:05.000 --> 29:24.000
 We're now in minute nine of this song.

29:24.000 --> 29:42.000
 This song, like I said, is 15 minutes long, and that's all it does.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
 The song just builds from that little phrase.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
 And it just builds the whole time, all the way through.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
 For 15 minutes.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
 Back here.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
 You raise your hand.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
 You know what that song is?

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
 Bolero by Ravel.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
 Maurice Ravel.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.000
 Yep.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
 Now, here.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
 Yeah.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.000
 Let's close in prayer.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.000
 That's it.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.000
 Let's get some baptisms going.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.000
 Now, that song, again, it's like some of you, how many of you guys heard that song?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.000
 Maybe you didn't know what it was.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
 Yeah, that song.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.000
 Everybody's heard that song.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
 It's one of the most famous classical pieces of recent past.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
 I mean, it's really famous.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
 But the whole song, again, is just this single phrase over and over again.

30:24.000 --> 30:28.000
 The whole work adds, builds, adds, builds, until it gets to the whole orchestra doing

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
 the same thing over and over again.

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
 In other words, to understand that song, all you would need is that one phrase and to

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
 see it built over and over and over again.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
 We'll come back to that in a minute.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
 Three weeks ago, we started a series, and we just started to look.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.000
 Let's reimagine the Bible a little bit, which is such a strange piece of ancient literature,

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
 you know, 1500 years, 40 or so different authors in different places and settings and times.

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
 And it's hard for us to read the Bible because we're not reading it as an original audience

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
 member.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
 We're 21st century Western kind of world people looking back at this thing.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
 We're not the original audience.

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
 And one of the sort of Bible scholar, a guy named John Walton, says, look, the Bible

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
 is for us, 100% Bible's for us.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
 But it's not to us.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
 The Bible was definitely written for us, but it's not written to us.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
 And so that makes it a little bit of a challenge.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
 But we know Christians, they have high regard for the Bible.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
 They'll say things like this.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
 This is the Bible saying, this is what people believe about the Bible.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
 It's in the Bible.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.000
 Hebrews 412, for the word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double edged sword.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
 It penetrates even to the dividing soul and to spirit, joints and marrow.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
 It judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
 Now, if people believe, then Hebrews 412 just says, if people believe that it actually did all this stuff,

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
 that's a pretty high level of importance for some words, that they actually can do all of these things.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
 So Christians are known for people who have a high regard for the Bible.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
 But some of you might be like, look, the Bible is maybe sort of wonderful,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
 but it just sort of feels like a collection of mythological stories,

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
 and I don't really know about that.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
 Others of you might say, well, the Bible might be valuable,

31:57.000 --> 32:00.000
 but it just, I mean, come on, let's get it with the times here.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
 It's for different people.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
 You just said, Jeff, it's not to us.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
 It's written to people a long time ago.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
 Maybe it needs a little updating, a little freshening up.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
 For a lot of people, that's sort of their belief.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
 Other people might say, look, and this might be a larger portion of us.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
 People are like, the Bible is really good, but it's so unapproachable.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
 It's just so very much unapproachable.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
 And as we think about it, the Bible, as we've been saying,

32:20.000 --> 32:23.000
 maybe one of the ways we got to reimagine or rethink about the Bible

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
 is less as a book and more as a bookstore,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
 or maybe perhaps like a library with different sections.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
 Because if we were to look at it, here are the different sections of the Bible.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
 All of them have different kinds of writing styles.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
 Each one of them requires its own unique way of looking at it.

32:36.000 --> 32:41.000
 You couldn't read the writings on narrative the same way you'd read the writings on prophecy

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
 or gospels or et cetera, things like that.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
 So once again, between law and narrative and prayer and wisdom and prophecy

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
 and gospels and letters and apocalyptic writing,

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
 they're all different styles of writing.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
 And what we've been saying throughout the series is this.

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
 Each section of the Bible requires its own unique approach

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
 to understand it as best as possible.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
 In fact, so much confusion about the Bible

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
 often comes with the fact that people have complicated it

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
 by coming to a particular section with the wrong approach.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
 And all we're trying to do in this particular series

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
 is to kind of say, let's just try to make sure our approach is lined up

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
 with the thing that we're reading.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
 Now, one section of the Bible, I think it's probably the toughest section

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
 of all of the Bible writing to read.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
 It is complicated largely because a lot of it is written in poetic language.

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
 It references things that we have no idea what they're talking about,

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
 because again, to us but not to us.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
 But as we look at it, I just want to show you,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
 when we get to this kind of reading,

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
 what you're going to see over and over again is a phrase.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
 Over and over and over again, like Polaro,

33:41.000 --> 33:44.000
 that starts small and begins to build and build and build.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
 And I'll show you what that is in a moment.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.000
 But when you read this most confusing kind of writing,

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
 which is called prophetic writing in the Bible,

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
 when you read it, it is so helpful to understand that single phrase.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
 Now, most people, so by the way, to just give you a sense,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
 in the Bible there are 16 books of the Bible that are written

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
 that would fall into this category, prophetic writing.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
 Four major prophets and 12 minor prophets.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
 They're not because they're minor, because they're less important.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
 It just usually has to do with their length, mostly.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
 But anyway, here's a list of them.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.000
 The ones that are in the yellow, the yellow, orange color,

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
 that's all of the major prophets.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
 So Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
 Daniel is the other one that has an asterisk there,

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
 because some people put that book in particular in another category.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
 But thank you for kneeling down, by the way.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
 That was really helpful. No one saw you.

34:28.000 --> 34:32.000
 Yeah, that was great.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
 Anyway, I know you're trying not to have anybody draw attention to that.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.000
 It's okay.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
 Anyways, there we go.

34:41.000 --> 34:46.000
 The other 12 of those are simply referred to sometimes as just the 12.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
 You'll see it actually referred to as the 12.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.000
 These are the minor prophets.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
 Now, for most people, when you talk about prophetic writing,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
 most people have the impression that we talk about prophecy.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.000
 If you looked it up like a definition of prophecy or prophetic writing,

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
 inevitably the first definition you would find would be

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
 talking about or predicting events in the future that happen at some point in the future.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
 But here's what's so interesting.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.000
 When it comes to the prophetic writing in the Bible,

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
 only 1% of the predictions that are in the Bible have yet to occur.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
 There are lots of people that you might know or come across.

35:16.000 --> 35:20.000
 You might even be a person who really loves the idea of future prediction in the Bible,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.000
 and there's definitely some of that,

35:21.000 --> 35:26.000
 but it's really an overwhelming minority of the amount of things that are in the Bible about future prediction.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
 Only 1% of stuff hasn't happened yet.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
 Here's some really conservative Bible scholars on the subject.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
 These guys wrote a book called How to Read the Bible for All It's Worth.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
 Really good book.

35:35.000 --> 35:39.000
 It's not thrilling, not a page turner, not great summer pool reading,

35:39.000 --> 35:40.000
 but it is, in fact, really helpful.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
 But anyway, it often happens that many Christians refer to the prophetic books

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
 only for their predictions about the coming of Jesus.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
 Now, what people would read the Bible prophecy books for

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
 is they would try to read it only as if it's anticipating Jesus,

35:52.000 --> 35:56.000
 who doesn't show up in his ministry depending on which prophet you're reading,

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
 between 400 and 700 years.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
 So these are what these guys are saying.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
 It happens that many Christians refer to the prophetic books

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
 only for predictions about the coming of Jesus,

36:04.000 --> 36:07.000
 as though the prediction of events far distant from their own day

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
 was the main concern of these prophets.

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
 In fact, using the prophets in this way is highly selective.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
 Consider the following statistics.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
 Less than 2% of Old Testament prophecy.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.000
 Old Testament is the part of the Bible that concerns God and His relationship

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
 with His own people before the ministry of Jesus,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
 the life and ministry of Jesus and the early church.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
 That's the New Testament.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
 Old Testament is about God and His relationship with His people

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
 before the ministry and life of Jesus.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
 Now, less than 2% of Old Testament prophecy is messianic.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
 That is to say, referring to a Messiah that's supposed to come.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.000
 Less than 1% concerns events yet to come in our time.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.000
 The prophets then did indeed announce the future,

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
 but it was usually the immediate future of Israel,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
 which is the northern kingdom of Israel,

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
 Judah, which is the southern kingdom,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
 and other nations surrounding them that they announced rather than our future.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
 Meaning, there's so many people who have an obsession

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
 with only about 1% of the content of the writing,

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
 which means that when it comes to prophetic writing,

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
 it's referring to something else altogether.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
 In fact, something that would be way more helpful to look at it

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
 if you ever come across some of this writing in the Bible,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
 is to look at it a little bit differently.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.000
 Now, to say it simply, prophetic writing is about God's word spoken

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
 to God's spokesperson to God's people.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
 That's the simplest way to talk about what prophetic writing is.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
 A prophet is simply a person who's been appointed by God

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
 to speak his words to his people.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
 And it's, like I said, only rarely is it about future stuff.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
 Like, that hasn't happened. It's very rare.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
 Now, when it comes to the actual tone of this writing,

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
 when we're talking about the prophetic writing tone,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
 it's highly confrontational.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
 It is unbelievably confrontational.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
 Because God's people were intended to have a relationship with God

37:39.000 --> 37:41.000
 that looks kind of like wedding vows.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
 We talked about this in the beginning of the series,

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
 you know, about what it means. It's called the covenant.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
 And there's covenant, what are called stipulations, or vows.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
 And they're saying, it's going to be you and us, God.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
 We're going to be together.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
 And they set up these terms and they're going to have this agreement.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
 And the prophets come around and they go, hey, wait a second.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
 You guys are supposed to keep up your end of the bargain

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
 and sort of be a part of this relationship

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
 in the way that you intended.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
 So it's always confrontational.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
 They're like, look, you stopped caring for the poor, the orphan in the widow,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
 which is like the trifecta of the most marginalized people.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
 You aren't caring for the poor, the orphan in the widow anymore.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
 Or you've made some other idols and you're worshiping them.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
 Or you're practicing some kind of permission, you know,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.000
 immorality, whatever it might be for yourselves.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.000
 And so the prophets words are not welcome words.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
 People aren't like, yay, a prophet's here.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
 They're always being confronted.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
 In fact, here's an example of some people having a conversation

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
 in the Bible about prophets and how they feel about them.

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
 Check this out. This is in 1 Kings 22, verse 7.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
 Jehoshaphat asked, is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
 whom we can inquire of?

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, oh, there is still one prophet

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
 through whom we can inquire of the Lord.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
 But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
 but always bad.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
 I don't want to ask that guy.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
 He always says things I don't want to hear.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
 This is over and over again.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
 To be a prophet is to be a person who's generally hated

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
 because all that person does is show up and say,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
 you guys aren't getting it right.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
 Over and over again.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
 Christi Anyabouleh in her book literally says it like this.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
 I love this.

39:04.000 --> 39:08.000
 God used prophets to speak the cold hard truth to God's cold hard people.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
 Over and over again, you see this.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.000
 The content of the prophetic messages is always what people needed to hear

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
 but what they rarely wanted to hear.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.000
 It's what people needed to hear but what they rarely wanted to hear.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
 Now, when we talk about the prophets, it's important to understand,

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
 we talked about this in the second week of the series,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
 about the idea of this last week,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
 about how the whole Bible fits into a giant narrative framework.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
 I want to show you what that is once again.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
 If you weren't here with us, here it is really quickly.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
 First, God is the good creator and sustainer of all things.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
 Second, God's people, God and people form an unlikely and unequal partnership with Him.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
 Third, people break the partnership with God.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
 At some point, they're like, we're kind of tired of this.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.000
 Four, life apart from God results in exile.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
 It means they get deported out of their own homes or invasion.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
 People come in and take them out like they take them over.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
 Five, by the way, people regret their decision

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
 and then six, God restores the partnership.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
 You can see this cover to cover in the Bible.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
 If you get this sort of framework, you understand the Bible a lot.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
 You see, you don't even kneel down, just walk right out.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
 There you go, head on out.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
 Now, what I said was helpful for us before is this,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
 and I meant it and it is a little bit goofy,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
 but if you think about the basic plot line as a romantic comedy,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
 it really helps you to understand,

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
 which I know a lot of you are going to be watching romantic comedy on Father's Day.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
 I just know it's a typical tradition in a lot of people's homes.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
 No, just kidding.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.000
 Now, when you talk about the prophets, when they show up,

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
 it's the same part in a movie, in a romantic comedy,

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
 when the person, the protagonist, breaks up with whoever they're with.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
 He breaks up with her, she breaks up with him,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
 they go back to their old life.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
 Then, inevitably, what you have is another person will say,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.000
 are you crazy? That's the best thing that ever happened to you.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
 It's a secondary character, a tertiary character,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
 is like, you should not have broken up with that person.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
 You've never been better in your whole life.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
 I can't believe you broke up with that person.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
 You've got to get back with them.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
 That's what the prophets say in these chunks of that story.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
 The people are like, I'm done with this partnership,

40:57.000 --> 41:00.000
 and they end up in sort of exile or invasion,

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
 and then people regret their decision, and the prophets are like,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
 no, no, no, wait, come back, come back, come back.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
 That's the language.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
 But there are other pictures of God's people and their relationship, too,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
 that isn't just sort of this romantic comedy kind of picture,

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
 although that's really prominent.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
 In fact, that's the third most used sort of reference to God and his people

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
 is as a husband and a wife.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
 That's actually how he describes his relationship.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
 The first most used picture is of a shepherd and a sheep.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
 This is the relationship God has with his people.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
 He's over and over again in the prophets.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
 But the second most used one,

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
 which is maybe particularly significant today,

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
 is that it's a father and child.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
 Throughout the writing of the prophets, there is this constant theme.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
 Again, you see that sort of begins to get developed,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
 and one of the things is as a father and a child.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
 Here's Hosea chapter 11, verse 1 says this,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
 Israel was a child. I loved him.

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
 Notice the language.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
 And out of Egypt, I called my son,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
 but the more they were called, the more they went away from me.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
 You get this very clear picture of what prophecy actually is.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
 Israel is called a child,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
 and out of Egypt, I called my son,

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
 but then they wandered away.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
 They broke up with me.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
 Now, what's so incredible to think about this

42:18.000 --> 42:23.000
 is that if you have a picture of this idea of this sort of confrontational tone,

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
 but as a father to his own kids,

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
 you could describe that or characterize it as simply tough love.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
 Now, some of you have been,

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
 someone just treated you like a jerk and they're like,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
 that's just tough love. That might not have been true.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
 Being a jerk is not the same thing as being tough love.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
 Just make sure we're all on the same page.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
 The operative thing here is love.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
 It is not licensed to be a jerk,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
 but part of loving another person sometimes

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
 is having the willingness to say the tough things.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
 Having the willingness to say the tough things.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
 That's different than the way the world is now.

42:52.000 --> 42:57.000
 The world would sort of basically categorize love

42:57.000 --> 43:00.000
 as a kind of blind acceptance and aloof permissiveness.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
 And if you were ever to say something,

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
 I don't know if that's okay,

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
 then that makes you an unloving person in the world's eyes,

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
 but we know that there is something really true about the idea

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
 that sometimes we need to hear the tough things because of love.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
 And when we encounter them in the Bible,

43:15.000 --> 43:18.000
 these tough things, it's so unbelievably important

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
 that you and I understand that the beating heart of the Bible

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
 is the calling of wayward kids home to their father.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
 The language might get really harsh.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
 The words might get really tough.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
 And if you were to extract just one or two of those words

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
 out of the Bible, you'd be like,

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
 what's this Bible all about?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
 And that's true.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
 But if you're to look at it in a bigger, broader sense,

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
 that this is about God calling wayward kids home to the father,

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
 then it becomes a little bit clearer what we're doing.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
 And that refrain starts to take on a little bit more shape.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
 And there's a command that does all of the prophets

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
 build their particular message on.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
 And it's one word.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
 It's the word that just starts out very...

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
 It starts really sort of simple and clean,

43:56.000 --> 43:59.000
 and it just keeps getting built on and expanding.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
 And that word is this word in Hebrew.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
 Teshuva.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
 Over and over and over again.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
 The root word of Teshuva is simply this word, turn.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
 All the time.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
 In fact, you can keep seeing it throughout the writing.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
 You just see this word, turn, comes up over, over again.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
 Return or turn.

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
 What this looks like in the book of Hosea,

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
 which I'll show you in a second, is this.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
 After a long series of painful, tough, love things

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
 that God is saying through His prophet Hosea to His people.

44:29.000 --> 44:32.000
 I mean, if you were to read the subject headings in the book of Hosea,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
 you would just see which the subject headings are added way later.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
 You'd just see things like punishment or anger or frustration

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
 that God has for Israel.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
 It's like these aren't the ones that people get tattooed

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
 or needle point onto a thing.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
 These are like, wow, this is really harsh stuff.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
 It is really harsh.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
 No question about it.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
 But after a long series of this painful, tough, love stuff,

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
 then comes this promise.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
 The very last chapter of Hosea looks like this.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
 I'm going to show you this.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
 Notice the language.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
 Hosea 14.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.000
 Return.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
 Shuv.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
 Shuv.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
 Return.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
 Return Israel to the Lord your God.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
 Your sins have been your downfall.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
 Take your words with you and return.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
 Shuv to the Lord.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
 Say to Him, forgive all our sins and receive us graciously

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
 that we may offer the fruit of our lips.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
 Remember, this is the prophet speaking to the people in God's voice.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
 Say, forgive our sins and receive us graciously.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.000
 Assyria cannot save us.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.000
 Will not mount war horses.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
 Will never again say our gods to what our own hands have made.

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
 What they're saying here is this.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
 They would make a thing out of wood or stone or something like that

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
 or iron and they would say, this is our God.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.000
 Make it and then call.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
 This is our God.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
 We just made this.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
 What they're saying is we're not going to have these idols anymore.

45:30.000 --> 45:33.000
 We're not going to ever say again our gods to what our own hands have made.

45:33.000 --> 45:40.000
 For in you, the fatherless find compassion continues.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
 Then God's voice switches to his own voice.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
 I'll heal their waywardness and love them freely.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
 For my anger has turned away from them.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
 I'll be like the do to Israel.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
 He, Israel, will blossom like a lily, like a cedar of Lebanon.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
 He will send down his roots.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
 Who is wise?

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
 Let them realize these things.

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
 What you get is that the invitation is a coming to confess

46:01.000 --> 46:05.000
 and anticipating what God will do to receive them.

46:05.000 --> 46:06.000
 That's what that is.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
 That's the words of the prophet at the end of that book.

46:09.000 --> 46:14.000
 Let me just ask you though, just right now in this moment,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
 a tough love message from God to me might say something.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
 Turn from blank.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
 Now you might be wrong, but if you had to guess,

46:22.000 --> 46:29.000
 if there was a tough love message to you right now from God,

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
 it might be like this.

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
 Turn from blank.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
 What is it?

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
 Is it a habit?

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
 Is it an addiction?

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
 Is it a kind of bitterness?

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
 Is it a self righteous kind of judgment about other people?

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
 Is it a sense of your own kind of elevated?

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
 I'm so wonderful.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
 Isn't it great to be me?

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
 It's too bad for everybody else.

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
 Is it a thing you keep going back to?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
 You can't stop coming.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
 You just keep going on back to it.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
 You keep trying to get away from it.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
 And you're like a lot of us, we kind of give ourselves,

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
 which just tends to be our typical things.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
 We tend to give ourselves a little bit of permission.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
 I'm not that, so I get to do this.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
 We keep going back to it.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.000
 This is true of me.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
 It's true of all of us.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
 Maybe it's, in some cases, it's a really good thing.

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
 It's like everybody would acknowledge the thing that you keep going back to

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
 or the thing that you hold on to is really good,

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
 but it's become the ultimate thing.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
 And in that sense, it's become something that it was never intended to become.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
 And maybe God's just sort of saying,

47:27.000 --> 47:30.000
 maybe you ought to turn from that.

47:30.000 --> 47:33.000
 Shoo, turn.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
 Now, it's no surprise.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
 Jesus has the continuation of the same message,

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
 even in his own teaching and his own ministry.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
 The same phrase comes up again.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
 Now, remember, here's the Hebrew word for to shoove,

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
 or turn, shoove, turn.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
 That word in Greek, the Old Testament,

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
 part of the life of the Bible,

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
 between God and His people,

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
 all that story before Jesus's ministry

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
 and in the life of the early church,

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
 which is the New Testament.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
 The New Testament is written, not in Hebrew, but in Greek,

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
 and that word looks like this in Greek, metanoia.

48:06.000 --> 48:10.000
 Now, when I show you the actual English version of the word metanoia,

48:10.000 --> 48:13.000
 remember what you're looking at is turn, turn.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
 I'm going to show it to you,

48:14.000 --> 48:15.000
 and some of you will recognize this word,

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
 but you've not heard it in this term before.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
 That word is repent.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
 Now, you've heard this word before, some of you,

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
 but it sounded like this, repent.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
 Repent.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
 There was like some sort of, usually,

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
 it had a really deep South anger kind of attached to it,

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
 and repent, you know, like, it's like a big threat,

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
 you know, like coming at you, and you heard it that way.

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
 I just want to say, when you look at it

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
 from the way that the Bible comes at it,

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
 it's just simply saying the word metanoia

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
 is just a whole life U turn.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
 I was going one direction, and I'm done going that direction,

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
 and I'm turning the other way.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
 Metanoia.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
 Return.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
 Here's Jesus's own words at the very beginning

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
 of His ministry in Mark chapter one.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
 The time has come, He said,

48:54.000 --> 48:55.000
 the kingdom of God has come here.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
 By the time it's coming, it's come to fulfillment.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
 The kingdom of God has come near.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
 Repent.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
 U turn, and believe the good news.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
 Now, with that being said,

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
 the turn is just, when Jesus is inviting people to this,

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
 what He's saying is, remember the big arc of the Bible,

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
 you don't have to live like orphans anymore.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
 You don't have to live like orphans at all.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
 And in that sense, repent isn't a threat,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
 like maybe some of us have heard it or characterized it.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
 It's really an invitation to come home.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
 The problem with Jesus over and over again

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
 is that people look to Jesus and are like,

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
 you keep inviting the wrong people to come home

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
 because they're too far gone.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
 Over and over again, Jesus, you keep telling people,

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
 you can turn back, you can come back,

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
 and the critics of Jesus always were like,

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
 wait a second, you can't tell those people

49:39.000 --> 49:43.000
 because they have gone too far, they cannot turn.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
 And maybe that's how you felt about yourself.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
 Maybe someone made you feel that way.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
 Maybe you understood that God is like,

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
 look, He's for some people, but I know what I've done,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
 and every single person in this room

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
 has some measure of some secrets in here

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
 that if people found out about Him,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
 we would all be devastated.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
 The criticism always of Jesus is that

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
 He kept associating with people and inviting people

50:04.000 --> 50:09.000
 who everybody else had regarded as too far gone.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
 Over and over again, Jesus reiterates,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
 that's not possible to be too far gone.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
 What's important to keep in mind in the imitation

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
 about sort of returning, what's so crucial to keep in mind

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
 is returning always involves leaving,

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
 meaning you can't stay in one place and also be in another.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
 But some of you might be going to Hawaii this summer,

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
 and we're all jealous of you, that's great.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
 We're excited for you to go there.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
 But you can't decide to go there and be there

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
 and also be here at the same time.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
 You're going to have to decide to leave one place

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
 to go to another, that's what returning is.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.000
 Returning always involves leaving.

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
 And there's also, in the early church,

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
 there's another way of depicting this whole journey.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
 You know, Shuv or Teshuva takes on a dramatic symbol

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
 and a return from an old life.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
 That's the way the New Testament,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
 the early church begins to characterize this idea

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
 of turning around.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
 It's the word baptism.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
 The word baptism gets actually clarified here.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
 It looks like this.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
 Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
 that's not referring to the dunking of people underwater,

51:08.000 --> 51:11.000
 or a wonderful horse trough like we have.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
 It's referring to something else.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
 The word baptism, which will get symbolized

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
 very much quite literally, because the word baptism

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
 means the word to immerse or to place into.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
 When they're talking about people being baptized into Jesus,

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
 the way this is written here is it's saying

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
 you have been placed into,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
 you have been fully immersed in the person of Christ Jesus,

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
 as it says right here.

51:34.000 --> 51:39.000
 Through faith, you are fully immersed in the person of Jesus.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
 It further gets more extreme.

51:41.000 --> 51:44.000
 Again, we're talking about coming home or returning.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
 Don't you know that all of us who are baptized into Christ Jesus,

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
 are put into His death.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
 That's weird, I understand.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
 Let me clarify even further.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
 We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
 In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
 through the glory of the Father,

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
 we too may live a new life.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
 Now, all that is to say is,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
 when we, through faith in Jesus,

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
 are put into His own life,

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
 we're buried with Him, just like He was buried,

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
 and then raised to walk in a new life.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
 Here's how I illustrate this.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
 Every time we do baptisms, some of you will recognize this.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
 Just so you get them, you're going to be really helpful.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
 Now, in faith, we're buried with Christ in baptism.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
 Remember, He died on a cross,

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
 buried with Christ in baptism, all of our sin and death.

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
 By the way, if you're being baptized,

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
 it's how long it holds you under the water.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
 Deep breath.

52:31.000 --> 52:35.000
 At this point, buried with Christ in baptism,

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
 raised to walk in a new life.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
 People are buried under the water

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
 and raised to walk in a new life.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
 That's what you're doing.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
 Your baptism is the symbolic representation

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
 of being baptized into Jesus.

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
 You've been baptized into Jesus,

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
 buried with Christ in baptism,

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
 raised to walk in a new life.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
 That's all that that is.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
 By the way, this is our new cult wave.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
 If you see each other, we all know you belong.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
 Okay, now, anyway.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
 Leaving and burying old things,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
 being raised in a new life in Jesus.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
 The invitation on this Father's Day,

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
 and you're going to see people get baptized in a minute,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
 the invitation, you can do it too.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
 You know, I haven't done this, I'm not sure if I should be baptized.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
 If you're not sure, but you have already said yes to Jesus,

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
 then you should do it.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
 And you're like, but my hair, I'm going out to brunch.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
 It's fine. Everybody will think it's cool.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
 Don't worry about it. We'll even give you a T shirt.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
 So anyway, now, the invitation

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
 on Father's Day is two words.

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
 And if you could get this, it's the message of the prophets.

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
 It's the summary of all the instruments

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
 and the chorus coming together.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
 That same melody played all the way out

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
 and blown up into huge ways.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
 The message of the prophets and the message to you

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
 on Father's Day, in a moment we'll see the baptism

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
 which will culminate in that baptism,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
 is this two word phrase.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
 Come home.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
 Come home.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
 Come home.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
 Come home.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
 Some of you need to hear that.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
 You haven't heard that in a long time.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
 Come home.

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
 Maybe for some of you, it's the first time

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
 you get to come home to Jesus.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
 You never really thought about it in those terms.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
 You thought about it like, I got to get my act together.

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
 Man, I got it because then I can come home.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
 And the invitation isn't to do that.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
 It's just to simply come home.

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
 Just, hey, leave that old life and come home.

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
 We'll take care of the rest of that stuff.

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
 Maybe you're tired of wandering around.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
 Come home.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
 Maybe even searching for some answers

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
 and you keep coming up.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
 Empty.

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
 And we say it all the time around here.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
 We do not have all the answers.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
 We just know that we belong into a life with Jesus

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
 for you.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
 That's a person for you.

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
 You're like, I don't know what to do.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
 I'm feeling still pretty empty.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
 Come home.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
 Maybe you're trying to make sense of a life

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
 that you're living.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
 And you're trying to figure out how to justify it

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
 or trying to convince yourself that it feels amazing.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
 That it is great.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
 But you know deep down it's not the life that you want.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
 Trapped in relationships.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
 Lost in a particular kind of loneliness

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
 and calling it success or calling it whatever.

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
 Come home.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
 Maybe you felt unwanted or unworthy.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
 Every one of us in here

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
 has cut stuff like I said.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
 We've all got secrets that if people knew about it

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
 they'd be horrified.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
 We've all given ourselves some permission at some point.

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
 Never too far gone.

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
 Come home.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
 Come home.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
 Baptism is a symbol of someone who has come home

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
 who has left one place and arrived at another.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
 It is the transformation

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
 that God has done but is not yet finished

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
 in a person.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
 It is not magic.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
 It does not make someone a Christian.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
 It is a symbol of what God has done.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
 And maybe for some of you

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
 the first step isn't

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
 just because you've already maybe you haven't come to this first step

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
 but the first step is probably just simply saying

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
 I want to come home.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
 Maybe you celebrated with baptism

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
 but let's start with coming home.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
 Would you pray with me and then we'll have some baptisms

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
 and we'll talk about coming home.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
 Jesus.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
 In so many areas of our lives

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
 we get lost and lonely and we wander

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
 and we need you to come get us

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
 so we want to leave our old life.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
 But sometimes we don't know how.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
 Father forgive us that we tried to make sense

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
 of things in a way that we did not know what we were doing

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
 and we screwed it up.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
 Forgive us. We need your forgiveness.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
 We want to come home.

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
 We want to come home.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
 Maybe for the first time in your life

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
 you don't know much about the church

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
 or the Bible or anything else

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
 but you've got a sense that God might be calling you home

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
 to him.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
 Maybe for the first time it's just yes Jesus

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
 I want to come home.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
 Father though

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
 baptism is something that maybe a lot of us have done

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
 or maybe we've seen before

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
 we continually live a life that is dying to old things

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
 and stepping into new things that you call us to

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
 by the power of your spirit Jesus.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
 Father we get to celebrate now

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
 this milestone in people's lives

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
 as they're buried with you in baptism

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
 and raised to walk in a new life.

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
 We're grateful that that's the work you do

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
 in an ongoing basis in our life Jesus

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
 in your name that we pray right now. Amen.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
 Folks we're going to do some baptism

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
 this is going to be pretty cool.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
 If that's something you want to do and you're like I didn't plan on it

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
 just head over there we'll get you all checked in

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
 we'll put you in this super warm water

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
 and we'll see you in baptism is going.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
 Will you stand as we celebrate

57:30.000 --> 57:52.000
 and sing together.

58:02.000 --> 58:07.000
 I could sing these songs

58:07.000 --> 58:11.000
 as I often do

58:11.000 --> 58:16.000
 every song I sing

58:16.000 --> 58:21.000
 and you never do

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
 so I throw up my hands

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
 and praise you again and again

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
 all that I have is a

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
 hallelujah

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
 hallelujah

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
 and I know it so much

58:42.000 --> 58:47.000
 I'm nothing else before a king

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
 except for a heart singing

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
 hallelujah

58:55.000 --> 59:02.000
 hallelujah

59:02.000 --> 59:07.000
 I've got wordless hearts

59:07.000 --> 59:12.000
 I've got just one move

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
 with my eyes wide

59:17.000 --> 59:22.000
 I will worship you

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
 so I throw up my hands

59:25.000 --> 59:30.000
 and praise you again and again

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
 all that I have is a

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
 and I know it so much

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
 I'm nothing else before a king

59:48.000 --> 59:52.000
 except for a heart singing

 hallelujah

 hallelujah

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000
 I know it's not much

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:19.000
 I'm nothing else before the King

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000
 except for our hearts singing

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000
 Hallelujah

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:31.000
 Hallelujah

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:34.000
 I know it's not much

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000
 I'm nothing else before the King

1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000
 except for our hearts singing

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:46.000
 Hallelujah

1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:51.000
 Hallelujah

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:56.000

 Come on, my soul, don't you get shy on me, lift up your soul

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:39.000
 Cause you got a lion inside of those looks

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:46.000
 Get up and praise alone

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:53.000
 Come on, my soul, don't you get shy on me, lift up your soul

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:58.000
 Cause you got a lion inside of those looks

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000
 Get up and praise alone

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000
 Come on, come on, come on, my soul

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:12.000
 Don't you get shy on me, lift up your soul

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:17.000
 Cause you got a lion inside of those looks

1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:24.000
 Get up and praise alone

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:31.000
 Come on, my soul, don't you get shy on me, lift up your soul

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:36.000
 Cause you got a lion inside of those looks

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:42.000
 Get up and praise alone

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:49.000
 So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again

1:04:49.000 --> 1:05:01.000
 The song that I have is a Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:08.000
 I know it's on but I've nothing else been born here

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:19.000
 A step or a heart sent me in, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:27.000
 So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:39.000
 The song that I have is a Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:46.000
 I know it's on but I've nothing else been born here

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:56.000
 A step or a heart sent me in, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:07.000
 So I throw up my hands and praise you again and again

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:17.000
 Singing Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:25.000
 I know it's on but I've nothing else been born here

1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:43.000
 A step or a heart sent me in, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:10.000
 I love you Lord, for your mercy never fails me

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:18.000
 All my days I've been held in your hands

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:26.000
 From the moment that I wake up until I lay in my head

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:36.000
 Oh I will sing of the goodness of God

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:43.000
 And all my life you have been faithful

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:51.000
 And all my life you have been so, so good

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:56.000
 Every breath that I am able

1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:03.000
 Oh I will sing of the goodness of God

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:14.000
 And all my life you have been faithful

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:21.000
 And all my life you have been so, so good

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:27.000
 With every breath that I am able

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:51.000
 Oh I will sing of the goodness of God

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:58.000
 Amen

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000
 That's so fun

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000
 By the way, if you're a person that we don't have time to do anymore

1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:07.000
 But we have another service so in 50 minutes we can do another one

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000
 If you're like I should've done it

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000
 But if I get a message from God to get baptized

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000
 This is your message from God right now, okay

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000
 I just want to tell you this is it

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000
 This is the miraculous moment that you're waiting for

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:18.000
 You can still do it next year

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000
 We have more service to do this

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000
 Would you receive this as a

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000
 blessing?

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000
 If you're not comfortable with

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000
 this, that's okay.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000
 However you want to hold your

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000
 hands, that's all right.

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000
 Would you receive these words as

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000
 a blessing to you from the prophet

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000
 Isaiah who writes these words?

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.000
 I made you and you are my servant.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:34.000
 I will not forget you.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:36.000
 I've swept away your offenses like

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:38.000
 a cloud and your sins like the

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000
 morning mist.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000
 Return to me, for I have

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.000
 redeemed you.

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:45.000
 Sing for joy, you heavens, for

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000
 the Lord has done this.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:48.000
 Shout aloud, you earth beneath.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000
 Burst into song, you mountains,

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000
 you forests and all your trees

1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:55.000
 for the Lord has redeemed.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:57.000
 He displays his glory.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000
 Wherever it is that you might

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:01.000
 wander, find yourself being

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000
 wayward, lost, lonely, overwhelmed.

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:05.000
 If you ever wonder to yourself,

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:07.000
 I've gone too far, there is no

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.000
 too far, that God's love cannot

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:12.000
 reach.

1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:13.000
 He calls you home to him.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:14.000
 Whatever it is that you

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000
 encounter, may the love of the

1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:16.000
 Father and the grace of the

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000
 Son and the fellowship and

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:20.000
 the grace of the Holy Spirit be

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:21.000
 among you all.

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000
 In Jesus name, amen.

1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000
 God bless you guys.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
 If you have needs for prayer,

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000
 hello to the prayer with you.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000
 Come back next service.

1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000
 We've got more baptisms to do.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000
 God bless you.

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:49.000
 God bless you.
