1054000	1056000	We got the same alma mater in Ohio
1056000	1058000	And when I got my first job out of college
1058000	1060000	I was living with them in Houston, Texas
1060000	1062000	And they let me live there like a little brother
1062000	1064000	For free, just trying to find my way
1064000	1067000	Somehow, I got myself out to California
1067000	1068000	Because of Kobe
1068000	1070000	And it's cool, like in this moment
1070000	1072000	I've been singing here and there, here and now
1072000	1074000	We're getting to lead and love God together
1074000	1076000	Again, so I'm so grateful for both of you
1076000	1078000	Love you, Kobe, don't y'all love Kobe?

1289000	1291000	Alright, hey everybody, how's it going?
1291000	1296000	Yeah, you guys chose a 10 o'clock service, you love traffic, you feel like it's raining
1296000	1299000	We can get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way
1299000	1301000	Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately
1301000	1305000	Like, how am I gonna put to test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus
1305000	1308000	But to find a parking lot that's miserable and work my way out of it
1308000	1310000	And you did it, you found it, way to go
1310000	1313000	Glad you guys made it, those of you guys are in the tent, glad you guys made it
1313000	1316000	Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well
1316000	1319000	It is so good to be with you guys and for those of you guys who are online
1319000	1321000	Of course, we say this every single week
1321000	1325000	The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to be together
1325000	1327000	Because the people of our church are amazing, and really you guys are
1327000	1330000	I'm really grateful to be with you guys, so fun
1330000	1333000	If you're, and I know you had to drive today through a puddle
1333000	1336000	You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car
1336000	1339000	And you made it, it's incredible, so great stuff happening, let's get right to it
1339000	1341000	We have a lot to cover as we talk about this
1341000	1345000	By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff and I just want to make sure we're clear
1345000	1348000	We do not have all the answers, this is not a church where we have everything figured out
1348000	1353000	Here's what we know, we're looking at Jesus, we believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus
1353000	1356000	And that requires everybody to help us along the way
1356000	1360000	Everybody's got a next step in that, so whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus
1360000	1364000	You're investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take
1364000	1367000	Our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all together
1367000	1370000	Who are work in progress kind of people doing that stuff
1370000	1373000	So, however that is, grateful that you're here, let's get right to it
1373000	1378000	I want to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention as you watch this commercial
1378000	1382000	Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person
1382000	1385000	Okay, but, I recognize it, it's fine
1385000	1390000	But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial
1390000	1393000	Check this out, okay, here we go
1393000	1398000	Mary Clary thinks her zipper bags are the best, and will never switch to Gladlock zipper bags
1398000	1399000	That's right, never
1399000	1405000	Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here, with either your bag filled with angry bees
1405000	1408000	Or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees
1408000	1412000	See that green color chain seal there, Mayor? That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed
1412000	1414000	Your bag doesn't have a green seal
1414000	1417000	You know, change is good, I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag
1417000	1419000	Just kidding, Mayor
1419000	1422000	When it really counts, don't get mad, get Gladlock zipper bags
1422000	1424000	Okay, some of you remember this commercial
1424000	1430000	Now, what I want to, obviously it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over-analyzing it and taking it way too seriously
1430000	1431000	Okay, that's the gift I bring
1431000	1433000	But, let's look at this for a moment
1433000	1437000	This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice
1437000	1441000	Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which makes the green thing
1441000	1445000	Which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial
1445000	1448000	And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag
1448000	1453000	Would you rather have hold the angry bees that we're going to give you
1453000	1459000	And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed to do this
1459000	1464000	The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea
1464000	1469000	That these people who are making this scenario happen, not only have they got bees to give a person to hold
1469000	1473000	But also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth
1473000	1475000	And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is
1475000	1480000	It's like an elevator that doesn't go anywhere, that's all that it is
1480000	1484000	It's the same thing, you're talking on a phone but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there
1484000	1489000	But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which they're agreeing to do
1489000	1492000	And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?
1492000	1497000	How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away, I don't want to do any of this
1497000	1501000	I don't care what bag you use, I'm not doing this, this whole thing is stupid
1501000	1505000	The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her in this thing
1505000	1507000	How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that
1507000	1510000	The question is, and why are people saying yes to this
1510000	1514000	And the question, over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously
1514000	1518000	The question is, well who's in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea?
1518000	1523000	Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person
1523000	1527000	And says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth, the whole thing is bizarre and absurd
1527000	1529000	And who's in charge here
1529000	1536000	Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety
1536000	1538000	Who's in charge here?
1538000	1542000	We're in week two of a series called The Bag of Angry Bees and it's a series on anxiety
1542000	1546000	Because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees
1546000	1550000	But I want to catch us up a little bit, if you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing fields
1550000	1552000	As we talk about this idea of anxiety
1552000	1557000	One of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety
1557000	1560000	Fear is the response to something that has happened
1560000	1564000	Like bear, person with a knife coming after us, oh my gosh that's fear
1564000	1568000	Anxiety is, what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?
1568000	1573000	That's anxiety, are you with me? One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing
1573000	1577000	And we said generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing that's happening
1577000	1580000	Or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern
1580000	1584000	But in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level
1584000	1587000	Or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level, are you with me?
1587000	1592000	Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something in common
1592000	1597000	Every single anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty
1597000	1601000	It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain
1601000	1606000	And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically
1606000	1609000	All of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety
1609000	1613000	It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current statistics on this
1613000	1618000	Which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have someone in your house perhaps
1618000	1621000	Or you yourself as someone who has anxiety
1621000	1624000	And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you grew up
1624000	1627000	What kind of healthy environment you might have encountered
1627000	1631000	Some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety
1631000	1636000	The best solution is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it
1636000	1639000	Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it
1639000	1642000	It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff
1642000	1644000	Compensate by being high functioning
1644000	1647000	And just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it
1647000	1650000	Because you shouldn't have to deal with it, just snap out of it
1650000	1654000	And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told us
1654000	1656000	We were told, here's what you should do
1656000	1659000	Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you
1659000	1662000	And then by comparison, you won't care anymore
1662000	1665000	You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people
1665000	1669000	So I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either of the anxieties
1669000	1670000	In either case
1670000	1674000	And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like
1674000	1677000	You know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower
1677000	1680000	Who maybe they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know
1680000	1683000	I'm suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression
1683000	1685000	And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you
1685000	1688000	Don't be anxious about anything, thank you so much
1689000	1691000	And they're like, well, don't be anxious
1691000	1695000	But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God
1695000	1697000	And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that
1697000	1703000	I guess I'm not supposed to have this, because the solution to having anxieties apparently just don't
1703000	1707000	And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal with it as a shame thing
1707000	1711000	Because I'm not supposed to have it, and so it never really gets dealt with at all
1711000	1716000	The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level
1716000	1720000	And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question
1720000	1722000	Who's in charge?
1722000	1726000	A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in charge?
1726000	1729000	What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way
1729000	1733000	My feelings or my thoughts are in charge, I'm not in charge, not me, I'm not in charge
1733000	1735000	I'm freaking out here
1735000	1739000	And this is where it starts, this is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue
1739000	1741000	In other words, probably another way to say it is this
1741000	1743000	Anxiety has a double effect
1743000	1746000	There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety
1746000	1751000	To say it this way, I'm freaking out about freaking out
1751000	1753000	And this is why people get stuck in it
1753000	1756000	It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough
1756000	1759000	It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety
1759000	1762000	Like, what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral
1762000	1766000	And you maybe have this experience, or do you know people who do
1766000	1768000	And here's what I want to do today
1768000	1770000	I want to give us one tool
1770000	1773000	It's not the answer to everything, it doesn't solve all the anxiety
1773000	1776000	It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool
1776000	1780000	That also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well
1780000	1783000	It's just gonna, and just again, to make sure we reiterate
1783000	1784000	I'm not an expert
1784000	1786000	Someone told you were doing a series on anxiety
1786000	1789000	You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure about Jesus
1789000	1793000	But I'll come here that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on this
1793000	1796000	I'm not an expert, I'm not a therapist, this is not my degree
1796000	1798000	I'm a fellow traveler in this
1798000	1800000	I do a little bit of research on some stuff
1800000	1802000	I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing
1802000	1805000	My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys
1805000	1809000	But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today
1809000	1811000	And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week
1811000	1813000	But I also want to tell you this, fair warning
1813000	1817000	The way we're gonna get to this one tool is a very windy road
1817000	1820000	Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes
1820000	1823000	I don't appreciate the laughter
1823000	1825000	It's fine, it's fine
1825000	1828000	But you're gonna be like, what in the world are we doing?
1828000	1831000	And then I promise I will bring it back home
1831000	1833000	But you're gonna wonder for a little bit
1833000	1836000	Because I'm gonna start in a place you may not expect
1836000	1838000	And then we're gonna get there
1838000	1842000	So I'm gonna start in ancient Near Eastern Temple construction
1844000	1846000	Because that's where you thought I was gonna go
1846000	1849000	Here's what we're gonna do, I'm totally serious
1849000	1851000	Ancient Near Eastern Temple construction
1851000	1853000	Here's what happens, it happens in six phases
1853000	1855000	This is the first of the phases, it starts like this
1855000	1857000	It's the boundary making of a particular thing
1857000	1859000	Here's where things are, here's where things are
1859000	1862000	This separates the sacred space from the not sacred space
1862000	1863000	Boundary making
1863000	1865000	Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filming
1865000	1868000	There's some filling of things and some further separation of things
1868000	1871000	There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces
1871000	1873000	Which are separated from other spaces
1873000	1875000	All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East
1875000	1878000	And the sixth phase of the Temple construction
1878000	1881000	Whatever it is, whatever god that's being worshipped there
1881000	1883000	You typically, it's placed within there on the sixth phase
1883000	1886000	So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation
1886000	1888000	Sort of the creation of a temple
1888000	1892000	And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple
1892000	1896000	To give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple
1896000	1900000	Now, there are six days, there's a seven day creation
1900000	1902000	But there's a six day creation narrative in the Bible
1902000	1904000	Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation
1904000	1907000	So god created mankind in his own image
1907000	1909000	And the image of god, he created them male and female
1909000	1911000	He created them, this is the sixth day of creation
1911000	1913000	Now, let me pause right here for a second
1913000	1916000	What's being said by this, many scholars agree
1916000	1920000	That the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible
1920000	1922000	Which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that yet
1922000	1924000	That's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this
1924000	1927000	That the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god's temple
1927000	1930000	The entire thing, no temple could contain him
1930000	1932000	So the whole cosmos is his temple
1932000	1936000	And instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day
1936000	1940000	It's a person, people become the representation of this god
1940000	1944000	In his temple, the whole cosmos
1944000	1947000	But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28
1947000	1950000	God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number
1950000	1952000	And fill the earth and subdue it some translations
1952000	1954000	And have dominion over it
1954000	1957000	Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky
1957000	1963000	And over every living creature that moves on the ground
1964000	1967000	So this, the people aren't just simply decoration
1967000	1970000	There's more there, they're blessed and they're told to multiply and have dominion
1970000	1974000	And the answer to the question, who's in charge of all of the created stuff?
1974000	1977000	The answer is, people are
1977000	1982000	People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation
1982000	1986000	In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to
1986000	1991000	Is god himself, other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things
1991000	1994000	It's gift to Genesis chapter 2, where it gets a little bit more specific about some of this stuff
1994000	1997000	Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground
1997000	2000000	All the wild animals and all the birds of the sky
2000000	2003000	And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them
2003000	2007000	And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name
2007000	2011000	So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals
2011000	2013000	Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man
2013000	2018000	This created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos
2018000	2020000	Which now has this responsibility to name everything
2020000	2022000	Again, this might be a challenge for some of you
2022000	2024000	Like I'm not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what's happening here
2024000	2026000	Because here's what's happening in naming
2026000	2030000	Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible
2030000	2033000	Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this
2033000	2036000	The first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing
2036000	2040000	So when someone names a thing, it says this is a that and I'm not that
2040000	2045000	That's not me, over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is from me
2045000	2047000	That's separate from me
2047000	2051000	Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me
2051000	2054000	Does that make sense, this is differentiation, you're different than me
2054000	2057000	That's what's being said, when we name a thing
2057000	2060000	Secondly what happens in naming is sort of an authority over
2060000	2065000	Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing
2065000	2069000	So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not me
2069000	2073000	But it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named
2073000	2076000	This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible
2076000	2078000	The Old Testament, the Old Covenant
2078000	2081000	Part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting
2081000	2083000	Kind of conversation about names
2083000	2085000	Not least of which is the name of God
2085000	2088000	Which is kind of if you read Moses' interaction with God
2088000	2091000	In the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before
2091000	2093000	But one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool
2093000	2095000	What do I tell people your name is as if to say
2095000	2097000	Because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed
2097000	2100000	It's so unbelievably important and sacred
2100000	2102000	In fact, to this day, you will find
2102000	2107000	Very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God
2107000	2110000	They'll refer to God as this word, Hashem
2110000	2115000	Who in that word simply means the name
2115000	2119000	Like we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God
2119000	2122000	Because it's so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment
2122000	2126000	So the word simply to describe God is just the name
2126000	2128000	Names are crucial
2128000	2130000	Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible
2130000	2132000	But you know this, even nicknaming has rules
2132000	2134000	Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up
2134000	2136000	Maybe you still go by that nickname
2136000	2138000	Maybe introduce yourself as a particular name
2138000	2141000	Maybe, you know, like, but there's some rules that go along with that
2141000	2142000	You know that there's rules about that
2142000	2144000	Now the first rule of nicknaming is
2144000	2146000	You don't get to choose your own nickname
2146000	2148000	You don't get to decide
2148000	2151000	Like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know
2151000	2153000	Now I'm going by MacGyver
2153000	2155000	Kind of rhymes with McGuire
2155000	2158000	Plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum
2158000	2160000	And like a, you know, rubber band
2160000	2162000	And he could like, oh look, let's fly away and escape
2162000	2165000	He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a
2165000	2167000	Like a scuba tank, he could save the world
2167000	2170000	You know, I'm going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now
2170000	2172000	Woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work
2172000	2174000	That's not how it goes, you can't choose your nickname
2174000	2177000	You don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you
2177000	2179000	And the way it always works is sort of a top-down method
2179000	2181000	Either the leader, the group of a person is like
2181000	2183000	You're now this, or the group decides
2183000	2185000	Hey, we've decided you're going by this nickname
2185000	2187000	You'll get to choose it, you can't declare it
2187000	2190000	It's what we've all decided because it's a top-down method
2190000	2192000	It's the way it's worked, it never gets to be the other way
2192000	2195000	It's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of
2195000	2197000	Ascribing a nickname to a person
2197000	2200000	And there's always, it tends to be, not always
2200000	2203000	But tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery
2203000	2205000	That's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of
2205000	2207000	A little bit funny, but it's based in truth
2207000	2209000	It always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that
2209000	2212000	You know, so I can never figure out, even to this day
2212000	2215000	Why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky
2215000	2217000	I can't figure out what the truth was
2217000	2219000	In there, I don't really know, that's weird
2219000	2221000	Anyway, so anyway, where was I going?
2221000	2223000	Now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your own name
2223000	2226000	Right, you guys watch Seinfeld and you know, maybe you saw
2226000	2228000	George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him
2228000	2230000	The top-down method is how this works
2230000	2232000	Remember this, this is going to matter in a second
2232000	2234000	And there's always an element of sort of truth and mockery
2234000	2236000	That kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff
2236000	2240000	Now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man
2240000	2242000	This man is what we would call demonized
2242000	2244000	He's possessed by a demon
2244000	2248000	And what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs
2248000	2250000	He doesn't have a house, he's all by himself
2250000	2254000	Now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world
2254000	2258000	We have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization
2258000	2260000	Or, you know, demon possession
2260000	2261000	A couple of different things
2261000	2264000	One of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go
2264000	2266000	Look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis
2266000	2269000	Anytime anybody had something, sort of some sort of mental illness
2269000	2271000	They would just naturally ascribe it to demon
2271000	2273000	That's a lot of demon, that's what that is
2273000	2276000	And I just want to say, you might be right
2276000	2278000	But I also want to just propose something else
2278000	2281000	The Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality
2281000	2285000	That is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular, ongoing basis
2285000	2289000	And sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that are happening
2289000	2293000	And I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic
2293000	2297000	People who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak
2297000	2300000	And yet there is still in the Bible this description of things
2300000	2305000	That where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do
2305000	2307000	And here's what I just want to say
2307000	2310000	The one does not exclude the other
2310000	2314000	There is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose back in the first century
2314000	2317000	And there is also demonic activity that's also at work
2317000	2319000	So I just want to make sure we're all clear on that
2319000	2320000	Are we okay moving forward with this?
2320000	2321000	Okay, good, here we go
2321000	2324000	Now, here's the scene, Luke 8, 26
2324000	2328000	They sailed to the regions of the Jeresians, which is across the lake from Galilee
2328000	2331000	This is in the northern part of Israel, there's two big lakes
2331000	2333000	There's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea
2333000	2335000	The Dead Sea is way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee is much more important
2335000	2336000	Because things live there
2336000	2340000	And on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other side
2340000	2343000	This is where people don't go very often
2343000	2347000	But when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town
2347000	2350000	For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house
2350000	2352000	But had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again
2352000	2356000	This is this person who lives by himself, naked in the tombs
2356000	2357000	And this man runs up to Jesus
2357000	2361000	And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice
2361000	2362000	What's important to keep in mind
2362000	2365000	When you see this, and the story is also in Mark 5
2365000	2368000	You can read this story, and one of the things that's crucial when you see it
2368000	2371000	Is there's always this really difficult distinction between
2371000	2374000	It's hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking
2374000	2376000	Who's talking here? Is the demon or is it the guy?
2376000	2379000	What I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of keep it
2379000	2382000	It's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me
2382000	2386000	Now, when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice
2386000	2389000	What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?
2389000	2391000	I beg you, don't torture me
2391000	2394000	So this is such an interesting kind of encounter
2394000	2399000	Some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon
2399000	2402000	Is an attempt to gain control over Jesus
2402000	2405000	Which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know rule number two
2405000	2409000	It's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this
2409000	2411000	This is what's going to be shown in a moment here
2411000	2416000	But there's this sort of crying out of Jesus' name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him
2416000	2417000	Verse 29
2417000	2419000	For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man
2419000	2421000	This is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence
2421000	2424000	Like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this
2424000	2426000	So Luke is recording what happened
2426000	2430000	He's like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever
2430000	2432000	Is because of this right here
2432000	2434000	For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man
2434000	2438000	And many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard
2438000	2442000	He had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places
2442000	2445000	Let's pause here for a second
2445000	2451000	So often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness
2451000	2455000	So often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness
2455000	2458000	It isn't that the man was like, oh man I feel like I got a thing
2458000	2459000	I got a ghost
2459000	2466000	It's that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone
2466000	2469000	Then Jesus asked him
2469000	2477000	What is your name?
2477000	2480000	Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him
2480000	2485000	The word legion to talk about a Roman legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers
2485000	2493000	So the idea of this means that there's a ton of demonic activity in this particular person
2493000	2496000	What is your name?
2496000	2499000	The question that's being asked here is who's in charge
2499000	2505000	Things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of the moment
2505000	2511000	And Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face of the whole idea here
2511000	2516000	The demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know, he's able to like name him
2516000	2522000	What's being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing
2522000	2524000	And takes control of the moment
2524000	2527000	And then there's this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next
2527000	2531000	Is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs
2531000	2533000	Which are nearby apparently
2533000	2536000	And then the pigs run into a lake and drown
2536000	2539000	That's the story, they're like, we're possessed!
2539000	2542000	And they drown, that's it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way
2542000	2544000	If you guys are wondering, that's what galloping pigs look like
2544000	2545000	And they run away and they drown
2545000	2550000	Now, the question that you have, which is a fair question is
2550000	2555000	What does this have to do with anybody's anxiety?
2555000	2560000	Let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this
2560000	2565000	One of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a linking and overlapping
2565000	2569000	Between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression
2569000	2572000	And that person themselves, they make it their identity
2572000	2574000	It's one of the most tragic things that happens
2574000	2577000	One of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety journey
2577000	2579000	This is my wife, she said
2579000	2584000	I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety
2584000	2587000	I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm always anxious, I'm anxious
2587000	2590000	She finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed
2590000	2592000	Maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious
2592000	2595000	This was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed
2595000	2598000	Fusing the two things together
2598000	2600000	Curtis Chang in his book, which I mentioned before
2600000	2602000	I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them
2602000	2605000	Or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know
2605000	2607000	No, just kidding, but if you want to borrow it, it's fine
2607000	2612000	But we have a couple, his book's great, but here's one of the things he says to this very effect
2612000	2617000	When we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended periods
2617000	2619000	I love the language
2619000	2624000	We identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these thoughts
2624000	2629000	The more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and over
2629000	2633000	We talked about this last week, about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative
2633000	2637000	The more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa
2637000	2641000	The more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads
2641000	2646000	The more we become indistinguishable from that narrative
2646000	2649000	Such that we cannot abandon those thoughts
2649000	2657000	And this mental fusion can be so complete, we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked
2657000	2662000	In other words, when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads
2662000	2671000	And it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating
2671000	2678000	You can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us
2678000	2682000	And find a way to rein it in
2682000	2685000	So here's what we need to do
2685000	2687000	Name it
2687000	2690000	Name it
2690000	2695000	We have to call the thing, whatever the thing is, we have to call it what it is
2695000	2698000	So that we can separate it from ourselves
2698000	2700000	Here's what Curtis Chang says once again
2700000	2705000	When we can name our thoughts, we recognize them as distinct from us
2705000	2707000	Differentiation
2707000	2712000	We're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in our minds
2712000	2716000	But they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation
2716000	2726000	There's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us
2726000	2731000	When I named my anxious thoughts, he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them
2731000	2735000	The more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them
2735000	2738000	The more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify
2738000	2741000	The more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement
2741000	2751000	And the more I said, oh, I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded away
2751000	2756000	So let's call it what it is, we've got to name it
2756000	2758000	Got to name it
2758000	2761000	And the question you have, which is a fair question, is how do I name it?
2761000	2765000	I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do with it?
2765000	2769000	And I just want to tell you, again, we're just going to look at kind of, this is the very beginning stages of stuff
2769000	2771000	But let's just talk about this for a moment
2771000	2777000	One of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in your life
2777000	2781000	Where are things not going smoothly? Where's their friction?
2781000	2783000	In other words, take it a different way
2783000	2788000	Can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated, afraid, etc.
2788000	2792000	Where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing?
2792000	2798000	For instance, if you're going through Del Taco and you're like, they gave you the wrong hot sauce
2798000	2801000	And you're like, that's a bummer, they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho
2801000	2803000	And they gave me regular old lame hot sauce
2803000	2806000	And you're like, that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response
2806000	2809000	If you're like, they didn't give me del scorcho, I'm burning the place down
2812000	2815000	By the way, that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho
2815000	2821000	Okay, but I'm just saying that there's a moment where you're like, my response should be a two, but it feels like it's a twelve
2822000	2826000	This is probably where you're going, maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to figure out what's going on here
2826000	2830000	There's a pattern where I'm overreacting, it should be a two and I'm giving it a twelve out of ten
2830000	2833000	Something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for all of us
2833000	2835000	And they're all different kinds of scales
2836000	2838000	For me, confession, okay
2839000	2842000	I have to be very, very careful
2843000	2846000	Anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children
2851000	2855000	Because there's a part of me, and I've told you guys this before, if you're with us last week, I said
2855000	2861000	The thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been chasing me is this right here
2861000	2863000	Being a disappointment and being irrelevant, these are the things that come up with
2863000	2867000	Now, in a competition, anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser
2868000	2870000	Not just lose, but be a loser
2871000	2872000	It's right into this stuff
2873000	2877000	So, I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition
2877000	2881000	Which is really, I have to measure, and some things I can't do
2882000	2886000	Whether it's like, doing things that's like an activity we do together, like surfing
2886000	2888000	It's like, my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot
2888000	2892000	But I'm like, you know, I just, I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as they are
2892000	2894000	They're in there, like, my oldest is twenty
2894000	2897000	He lives, like, it goes to school right next to the beach
2897000	2899000	He surfs constantly, he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes
2899000	2901000	I'm like, what is wrong with the world?
2901000	2903000	Anyway, but he does that, he's awesome
2903000	2905000	And my other kids are incredible, all the things they do
2905000	2908000	And I'm like, I'm out, and it's like, I'm making it a competition and I have to win
2908000	2911000	We're playing cards, we're playing horse, and how much does it matter if I'm like
2912000	2915000	Playing horse with my son, how important is it that I win?
2916000	2918000	Crucial is the answer to that question
2919000	2922000	But it should be a two, and it's a twelve, why does it matter?
2922000	2924000	I have to be very careful with these things
2924000	2927000	Where's their friction, name it, you have to find some of the friction
2927000	2929000	It's probably one of the most helpful things you can do
2929000	2932000	But there's another layer to this, and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult
2932000	2935000	And it's nonetheless crucial, and by the way, I have to apologize in advance
2935000	2938000	Before I give you this, I'm going to show you it in a second
2938000	2940000	It rhymes, okay?
2940000	2943000	And I always am afraid when it rhymes, like, oh gosh
2943000	2945000	We just packaged this up in a little neat little thing
2945000	2947000	And there's probably a little tiny little, if you look closely
2947000	2950000	A little TM on the top right of the circle around it, like trademark
2950000	2953000	There's nothing, I just want to make sure, I want you to make sure you remember it
2953000	2956000	But for those of you guys that have a high, like really sensitive cheese meter
2956000	2958000	This is going to set you off, okay?
2958000	2961000	It's very cheesy, but it's really crucial, okay?
2961000	2964000	So bear with me, okay? You guys ready for that?
2964000	2966000	I think you can handle this, okay?
2966000	2969000	So not only are we finding the friction, where is there this ongoing sort of pattern
2969000	2971000	Where I'm overreacting to certain things
2971000	2975000	But bear with me, probably what is more crucial than that
2975000	2979000	Is to find the fiction behind the friction
2979000	2981000	I do not appreciate that, sir
2981000	2991000	Because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie
2991000	2995000	Behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie
2995000	3000000	Like, wow, that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular thing
3000000	3003000	And the thing that people, it may not be you, but people that are around you
3003000	3006000	That might suffer from anxiety, they're believing a particular lie
3006000	3008000	That's being rehearsed over and over again in their head
3008000	3011000	And it's nearly perfect, and the question we have to ask
3011000	3015000	Which is a very courageous question, which may require actual therapy
3015000	3017000	You might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff
3017000	3021000	But the point is, there is 99%
3021000	3023000	I'm going to go 100%, okay?
3023000	3027000	There's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety
3027000	3029000	There is a perfect lie behind it
3029000	3036000	And to ask the question, where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial
3037000	3039000	Behind the anxiety is a particular lie
3039000	3042000	I've showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down, and it's a lie
3042000	3043000	Let me give you some things to think about
3043000	3046000	If you're having trouble kind of identifying it, this is not going to answer every question
3046000	3048000	But maybe some of these you might connect with, okay?
3048000	3049000	Here
3049000	3052000	If blank happens, it means I've lost control
3052000	3055000	And when I lose control, the whole world goes at just whatever
3055000	3057000	I have to be in control
3057000	3059000	And if something happens, it means I've lost control
3059000	3063000	It could be any number of things for you, it can be small, and it can be big
3063000	3067000	It can be I'm late for dropping my kids off for school, I'm late for picking my...
3067000	3071000	It could be I'm late for school, it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in
3071000	3075000	It could be if I don't connect with these people, if I mess up my own
3075000	3079000	If I don't get on Instagram enough times, or I don't see these things, it means I've lost control
3081000	3084000	Some of you might have this scenario, there won't be enough
3084000	3087000	I know what will happen, there's just not going to be enough blank
3087000	3089000	Filling whatever you want there
3089000	3092000	Money, attention, affection, love
3092000	3095000	I know that if I say yes to this now, then there won't be enough later
3095000	3098000	Or if this person says yes to this in my life
3098000	3101000	There's only a certain, there's like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need
3101000	3105000	And if they take a slice, it's going to be one less thing available for me, or for anybody else
3105000	3107000	Or just won't be enough of whatever it is
3107000	3110000	You can, maybe that's you
3110000	3113000	Some of you have this, if I can't blank well, whatever it is
3113000	3116000	I'll be alone
3116000	3120000	If I can't do well as a student, if I don't perform well at my job
3120000	3124000	If I'm not a good friend, if I don't appear wonderful, if I don't do beauty well
3124000	3126000	If I don't do personal health and fitness well
3126000	3131000	If I don't do living the California life well, then I'll be all alone and people won't want me
3133000	3136000	That may be you
3136000	3139000	Some people have this one, it just connects with a lot of people
3139000	3142000	Things are going so great, but now what?
3142000	3148000	Like I know everything's awesome, but that only means there's an impending doom right around the corner
3148000	3151000	I feel like things are going great, my friendships are great
3151000	3154000	Maybe you're single and you've got all your crew of friends, you're like, we're getting along great
3154000	3158000	And we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing
3158000	3161000	It's all going to go, something's going to happen immediately
3161000	3163000	Maybe you're a person who's got a mom group and you're all hanging out
3163000	3166000	Things are incredible, you've got your kids and your marriages are incredible
3166000	3169000	And you're like, it's a matter of time before everything goes away
3169000	3173000	There's going to be disease, there's going to be a volcano, there's going to be something that swallows us up
3173000	3175000	We're all going to die, I just know it
3175000	3178000	There'll be a puddle on the way to church, I mean, you never know
3178000	3181000	A lot of people have this, things are going great, but they can't forever
3181000	3184000	Just waiting for the house of cards to fall
3184000	3186000	That's an anxiety
3186000	3190000	Some people have this, that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do
3190000	3193000	However, I try to communicate who I am, I'll never be fully understood
3193000	3195000	Which is a matter of being not loved and being alone
3195000	3197000	Once again, I just cannot be an understood person
3197000	3201000	And this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state
3201000	3203000	Some people have this
3203000	3206000	What if I or we never get through blank?
3206000	3208000	We're a tough patch in our marriage
3208000	3210000	I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life
3210000	3213000	I want to meet Mr. Wright, I want to meet Mrs. Wright
3213000	3215000	I want to be around these people
3215000	3218000	But I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it
3218000	3220000	What if we never get through it?
3220000	3224000	What if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness, I never get through it?
3224000	3225000	What if that never happens?
3225000	3229000	I'm just preparing myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel
3229000	3231000	So what if I never get through it?
3234000	3239000	All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we're worried about
3239000	3242000	And they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff
3242000	3244000	And for some of you, it may not be you
3244000	3246000	Like I said, you may not be the person who's got anxiety
3246000	3248000	You may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff
3248000	3254000	But you probably live with people and you're like, why are they reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2?
3254000	3258000	Because there's probably a fiction behind it that's generating that sort of thing
3258000	3261000	Now, what do we do with that?
3261000	3264000	Now, this is really important
3264000	3270000	What we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus
3270000	3275000	Some of you are like, look, I'm okay with Jesus that came because you're talking about anxiety and some cool stuff
3275000	3279000	But I just want to tell you, there's a dimension that we're going to talk about here
3279000	3282000	Which is so important to understanding what it is to walk with Jesus
3282000	3284000	Because there's a spiritual dimension to faith
3284000	3286000	It is not just practical help for all these kinds of things
3286000	3288000	You go to lots of places to get that
3288000	3290000	And we're okay with that, by the way
3290000	3292000	We're a church, we're kind of okay with Jesus
3292000	3295000	But I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next
3295000	3297000	That's going to push this a little further
3297000	3301000	And I think it's probably, for some of you, maybe like an invitation to step into something you've not yet considered
3301000	3303000	But here's what I want to do
3303000	3306000	Remember, when you look back at the story of Jesus with this demonized person
3306000	3309000	This man who's naked in the tombs
3309000	3312000	It's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon
3312000	3316000	Jesus doesn't need the name to be able to take control, which is really important to keep in mind
3316000	3319000	But Jesus extracts the name of the demon, the demon says his own name, Legion
3319000	3321000	The guy doesn't do it
3321000	3323000	The demon's the one who drove him into isolation
3323000	3326000	He's the demon, he's the naked demon guy living in the tombs
3326000	3327000	Doesn't live at home anymore
3327000	3330000	And even the guy couldn't name the thing
3330000	3333000	Jesus has to draw it out of this person
3333000	3335000	And maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff
3335000	3338000	You actually need some supernatural assistance to do it
3338000	3340000	You actually need this
3340000	3342000	This is what Jesus really can do
3342000	3344000	And the inner stuff, all this stuff, it's hard
3344000	3347000	It requires courage and humility
3347000	3350000	And this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today
3350000	3353000	Let's go back to Philippians 4, 6 and 7
3353000	3355000	Do not be anxious about anything
3355000	3358000	But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving
3358000	3359000	Present your request to God
3359000	3361000	And the peace of God which transcends all understanding
3361000	3363000	Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus
3363000	3365000	What's so crucial to keep in mind is
3365000	3367000	Every anxious person loves the second part of that
3367000	3369000	The peace of God which transcends understanding
3369000	3371000	We all want that
3371000	3373000	Even if you're not an anxious person, you're like, that sounds great
3373000	3375000	The peace of God which is beyond even my own understanding
3375000	3376000	I want that
3376000	3378000	But what I want to do today is this
3378000	3380000	During everything in mind
3380000	3382000	I want to focus on this part of that verse
3382000	3384000	Prayer and petition
3384000	3387000	When most of us think about prayer
3387000	3389000	We think about petition
3389000	3391000	Which is asking for a particular thing
3391000	3393000	Petition means I'm asking for a particular thing
3393000	3396000	The language of petition is in the First Amendment
3396000	3399000	The right to petition the government is part of what's in there
3399000	3401000	Like that actually gets to ask for a particular thing
3401000	3404000	To make something, to make a request, a formal request of a thing
3404000	3406000	Which is part of what's being described here
3406000	3409000	In fact, even it says, make your request known to God
3409000	3411000	But there's also something else there
3411000	3413000	It says prayer and petition
3413000	3415000	Which they're under the same umbrella
3415000	3417000	But there's something different about the two things
3417000	3419000	Which is worth thinking about
3419000	3421000	Because for a lot of us, all we think about is prayer
3421000	3423000	Is while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers
3423000	3425000	And I'm ready for a couple different answers
3425000	3427000	You know, like maybe you heard that growing up
3427000	3429000	It's like, yes, you can have what you want, no you can't
3429000	3431000	Or you just have to wait around a little while
3431000	3433000	It's like, that's all we know about prayer
3433000	3435000	I don't want to say that there's a beautiful part to that
3435000	3439000	But I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that
3439000	3441000	Because maybe in prayer what we get to do
3441000	3446000	Is to seek God to do something that's beyond asking him for stuff
3446000	3448000	Or to just simply solve a thing
3448000	3450000	One of the things we get to do in prayer
3450000	3455000	Is actually to ask God to reveal something to us, about us
3455000	3458000	Which means we're not asking, we're just listening in effect
3458000	3460000	Here's what the Psalmist writes in Psalm 139
3460000	3462000	These famous words, search me God and know my heart
3462000	3466000	Test me and know my anxious thoughts
3466000	3468000	See if there is any offensive
3468000	3471000	Some translations have the word hurtful way in me
3471000	3476000	And lead me in the way everlasting
3476000	3479000	Like there is some way through the anxiety
3479000	3482000	To be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life
3482000	3484000	Not just forever, like someday far away
3484000	3487000	But right now in the present
3487000	3489000	To say it differently, again, another rhyming thing
3489000	3491000	Please buckle your seatbelt, I apologize
3491000	3493000	Please read this, okay, stay with me
3493000	3496000	All healing, whether it's like a medical
3496000	3499000	Like you broke your foot, you got an ear infection
3499000	3505000	You got a heart condition, all healing begins with revealing
3505000	3508000	We have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing
3508000	3511000	So that it can be addressed
3511000	3513000	This is part of the naming process, right
3513000	3515000	And it's scary because we have to see it for what it is
3515000	3519000	So here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to give you a prayer
3519000	3522000	It is a two-word prayer, you can practice it whenever you want
3522000	3524000	However you want, I'm going to give you a rundown
3524000	3526000	On how to do it right now in a second
3526000	3528000	But it's a two-word prayer that requires some courage
3528000	3532000	And it's different for a lot of you than maybe you haven't yet understood what prayer is
3532000	3535000	And here's what it looks like, you ready?
3535000	3539000	Search me
3539000	3542000	Search me
3542000	3545000	There's something that needs to be revealed to me
3545000	3547000	That I can't find on my own to be named
3547000	3549000	So that I can differentiate it from myself
3549000	3552000	And I need God to reveal it in me
3552000	3555000	With tenderness, with care, not with shame
3555000	3558000	Not with condemnation, but with love
3558000	3560000	That gets drawn out
3560000	3563000	So, that in mind
3563000	3566000	Let's pray
3566000	3569000	I'm going to give you a moment, just as your eyes are closed
3569000	3573000	To sit in the stillness of this
3573000	3577000	If there is a contrast between the loudness
3577000	3581000	And the voices of anxiety, it must be stillness
3581000	3585000	And silence
3585000	3589000	Jesus
3589000	3593000	Search me
3603000	3607000	Search me
3607000	3613000	Jesus that I might find where there's friction
3613000	3642000	Search me, Jesus, that I might find where there's friction.
3642000	3655000	Search me, Jesus, to uncover the lie, the fiction that's undergirding that friction.
3673000	3680000	When I can't name them, will you name them, my anxious thoughts, Jesus?
3689000	3695000	Will you lead me in the way everlasting?
3702000	3720000	Father, would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives?
3720000	3723000	Would you hear your name?
3723000	3728000	The name that rescues, that breaks through into the darkness, Jesus.
3728000	3730000	Jesus.
3730000	3733000	It is in your name that we pray, Jesus.
3733000	3735000	Amen.
3760000	3777000	Let it break, and your name still, call the seed of still, the rage and need of still, every way.
3777000	3784000	And your name, Jesus, Jesus.
3784000	3791000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3791000	3798000	You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.
3798000	3808000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3808000	3819000	We call these bones to live, and call these lungs to sing once again.
3819000	3826000	I will praise Jesus, Jesus.
3826000	3833000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3833000	3840000	You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.
3840000	3848000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3848000	3854000	Jesus, Jesus.
3854000	3861000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3861000	3868000	You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.
3868000	3877000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3877000	3881000	Jesus, Jesus.
3881000	3888000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3888000	3895000	You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.
3895000	3904000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3904000	3910000	Would you do this? Would you just stand together?
3910000	3918000	One of the things that, you probably heard me say this before, if you've been around, which is when we're singing, we're setting our collective prayer to music.
3918000	3919000	That's all we're doing.
3919000	3924000	And there's some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same time, in the same place.
3924000	3928000	There's something that happens in that, and I don't know how to explain it, I just know that it does.
3928000	3937000	And so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices, to sing that one more time together, and then I'll close out our time.
3937000	3939000	So would you lead us in that?
3939000	3944000	We sing Jesus, Jesus.
3944000	3951000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3951000	3958000	You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.
3958000	3968000	You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.
3968000	3972000	Would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing?
3972000	3976000	Where there is darkness that needs to tremble, you can call in the name of Jesus.
3976000	3987000	Might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety and depression and loneliness and isolation?
3987000	3995000	May you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God, search me and know my anxious thoughts.
3995000	4002000	See if there's a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting.
4002000	4014000	Whatever you're up against, may you know, may it be conferred upon you the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit in Jesus' name.
4014000	4016000	So good to be with you. Amen.
4016000	4018000	So great to be together. We'll see you guys later.
