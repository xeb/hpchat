956000	960000	Because he lives.
960000	969000	I can face tomorrow because Jesus lives.

1032840	1035240	Y'all, hey, oh, I love you too.
1035240	1036320	I love you too.
1036320	1037880	Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today.
1037880	1039040	This is an amazing church.
1039040	1039880	So glad.
1039880	1043520	I'm singing with my sister, Brittany, who is Kobe's wife.
1043520	1045680	And she's singing for the first time in, what, four or five
1045680	1047320	years?
1047320	1047820	Jesus.
1051820	1053920	Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back.
1053920	1056160	We got the same alma mater in Ohio.
1056160	1058200	And when I got my first job out of college,
1058200	1060360	I was living with them in Houston, Texas.
1060400	1062880	And they let me live there like a little brother for free,
1062880	1064440	just trying to find my way.
1064440	1068600	Somehow, I got myself out to California because of Kobe.
1068600	1069440	And it's cool.
1069440	1071320	Like, in this moment, I've been singing here and there
1071320	1071880	here now.
1071880	1074640	We're getting to lead and love God together again.
1074640	1076080	So I'm so grateful for both of you.
1076080	1076640	Love you, Kobe.
1076640	1078760	Don't y'all love Kobe?
1078760	1081840	I ain't going to say nothing smart this time.
1081840	1082280	All right.
1082280	1083600	Well, I love you too.
1083600	1085280	And why don't you tell some people around you.
1085280	1086040	I love you.
1086040	1087360	And then you may have a seat.
1091160	1093440	Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today.

1103000	1104880	very grateful that you've come here.
1104880	1106660	And you're here today.

1110100	1113400	At Harbor Point, giving us more than just a financial
1113400	1114240	transaction.
1114240	1115920	It's part of our worship.
1115920	1117400	It's a tangible, exceptional, and it's
1117400	1118720	an exceptional tour.
1118720	1124400	It's a tangible expression of our devotion and gratitude to God, demonstrating that our
1124400	1127240	hearts are centered on Him.
1127240	1132520	Each week we bring our offerings as an expression of our commitment to God's work in and through
1132520	1134040	His Church.
1134040	1138280	Whether this is your first time giving or you're continuing your giving, please take
1138280	1141920	a look at the various ways you can contribute.

1153200	1159360	on Sundays at 10am and at Harbor Point for our regular weekend services and don't forget
1159360	1166240	Encore, bringing our At The Movies experience to Regency Theatre on Thursday nights at 6.30pm.
1166240	1173120	It's a fantastic opportunity to invite your friends, neighbors, and coworkers.
1173120	1176680	If you've been a part of Harbor Point for a while, you've heard us say that every good
1176680	1182520	thing that we do is done through great volunteers, and that's you.
1182520	1188100	When I think of some of the amazing volunteers, I think of Travis and Tina, who serve so faithfully
1188100	1190600	on our worship team for Harbor Point's VBS.
1190600	1197720	We're so grateful for how they gave their time and talents to pour into the next generation.

1284640	1288360	on anxiety called A Bag of Angry Bees.
1289080	1291080	All right, hey everybody, how's it going?
1291080	1293920	Yeah, you guys chose, you chose the 10 o'clock service.
1293920	1294920	You love traffic.
1294920	1295920	You felt like it's raining.
1295920	1299280	We could get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way.
1299280	1302420	Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately, like how am I going to put to
1302420	1306320	test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus, but to find a parking lot that's
1306320	1308000	miserable and work my way out of it.
1308000	1309000	And you did it.
1309000	1310000	You found it.
1310000	1311000	Way to go.
1311000	1312000	Glad you guys made it.
1312000	1313000	Those of you guys who are in the tent, glad you guys made it.
1313000	1315680	Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well.
1315880	1317680	It is so good to be with you guys.
1317680	1321120	And for those of you guys who are online, of course, we say this every single week.
1321120	1324040	The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to
1324040	1326360	be together, because the people of our church are amazing.
1326360	1327360	And really, you guys are.
1327360	1328520	I'm really grateful to be with you guys.
1328520	1329520	So fun.
1329520	1332840	And I know you had to drive today through a puddle.
1332840	1335920	You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car.
1335920	1336920	And you made it.
1336920	1337920	It's incredible.
1337920	1338920	So great stuff happened.
1338920	1339920	And let's get right to it.
1339920	1341120	We have a lot to cover as we talk about this.
1341120	1345120	By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff, and I just want to make sure we're clear.
1345120	1346120	We do not have all the answers.
1346120	1347120	This is not a church.
1347120	1348120	We have everything figured out.
1348120	1349120	Here's what we know.
1349120	1350120	We're looking at Jesus.
1350120	1354260	We believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus, and that requires everybody
1354260	1356200	to help us along the way.
1356200	1357280	Everybody's got a next step in that.
1357280	1360640	So whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus, you're investigating the church
1360640	1363840	or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take.
1363840	1367240	And our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all
1367240	1368240	together.
1368240	1370200	We're a work in progress kind of people doing that stuff.
1370200	1372320	So however that is, grateful that you're here.
1372320	1373320	Let's get right to it.
1373320	1377680	I'm going to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention
1377680	1378680	as you watch this commercial.
1378680	1382680	Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person, okay?
1382680	1385520	But I recognize it, it's fine.
1385520	1391120	But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial.
1391120	1392120	Check this out, okay?
1392120	1393120	Here we go.
1393120	1397440	Mary Clary, thanks for her zipper bags are the best, and we'll never switch to Gladlock
1397440	1398440	zipper bags.
1398440	1399440	That's right, never.
1399440	1403640	And Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here with either your
1403640	1408080	bag filled with angry bees or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees?
1408080	1410160	See that green color chain seal there, Mary?
1410160	1412120	That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed.
1412120	1414320	Your bag doesn't have a green seal.
1414320	1415840	You know, change is good.
1415840	1418400	I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag.
1418400	1419400	Just kidding, Mary.
1419400	1421320	When it really counts, don't get mad.
1421320	1422760	Get Gladlock zipper bags.
1422760	1424800	Okay, some of you remember this commercial.
1424800	1428440	Now, what I want to, obviously this is, it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over
1428440	1430680	analyzing it and taking it way too seriously, okay?
1430680	1431800	That's the gift I bring.
1431800	1433680	But let's look at this for a moment.
1433680	1437520	This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice.
1437520	1440640	Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which
1440640	1444400	makes the green thing, which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was
1444400	1445400	so crucial.
1445400	1450360	And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag would you rather have hold
1450360	1453480	the angry bees that we're going to give you?
1453480	1458200	And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed
1458200	1459800	to do this.
1459800	1464920	The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea that these
1464920	1469240	people who are making this scenario happen not only have they got bees to give a person
1469240	1473280	to hold, but also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth.
1473280	1478960	And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is, it's like an elevator that
1478960	1479960	doesn't go anywhere.
1479960	1480960	That's all that it is.
1480960	1481960	It's the same thing.
1481960	1484680	It's not a phone, but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there.
1484680	1488120	But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which
1488120	1489880	they're agreeing to do.
1489880	1493200	And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?
1493200	1496200	How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away?
1496200	1497880	I don't want to do any of this.
1497880	1499520	I don't care what bag you use.
1499520	1500800	I'm not doing this.
1500800	1502200	This whole thing is stupid.
1502200	1505040	The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her
1505040	1506040	in this thing.
1506040	1508000	How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that?
1508000	1510840	The question is, and why are people saying yes to this?
1510840	1515080	The question over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously.
1515080	1517560	The question is, well, who's in charge here?
1517560	1519080	Who thought this was a good idea?
1519080	1520480	Who thought this would be okay?
1520480	1524000	Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person
1524000	1525680	and says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth.
1525680	1530000	The whole thing is bizarre and absurd and who's in charge here?
1530000	1537040	Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety.
1537040	1538040	Who's in charge here?
1538760	1542280	We're in week two of a series called the bag of angry bees and it's a series on anxiety
1542280	1547000	because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees.
1547000	1548000	But I want to catch us up a little bit.
1548000	1550720	If you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing field
1550720	1554400	as we talk about this idea of anxiety, one of the things we said last week was this,
1554400	1557960	is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety.
1557960	1562560	Fear is the response to something that has happened, like bear, person with a knife coming
1562560	1563560	after us.
1563560	1564960	Oh my gosh, that's fear.
1564960	1568400	Anxiety is what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife?
1568400	1569400	That's anxiety.
1569400	1570400	Are you with me?
1570400	1573400	One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing.
1573400	1576720	And we said that generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing
1576720	1581560	that's happening or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern but in anxiety
1581560	1586440	we take that up to an unreasonable response level or an unreasonable sort of anticipation
1586440	1587440	level.
1587440	1588440	Are you with me?
1588440	1591840	Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something
1591840	1592840	in common.
1592880	1598120	Anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty.
1598120	1602400	It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain.
1602400	1606040	And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically
1606040	1609280	all of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety.
1609280	1612840	It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current
1612840	1616920	statistics on this, which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone,
1616920	1621680	you have someone in your house perhaps, or you yourself as someone who has anxiety.
1621680	1624560	And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you
1624560	1627920	grew up or what kind of healthy environment you might have encountered, some of you got
1627920	1632800	the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety, the best solution
1632800	1636320	is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it.
1636320	1639040	Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it.
1639040	1643680	It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff, compensate by being high functioning
1643680	1647600	and just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it because you shouldn't
1647600	1649800	have to deal with it, just snap out of it.
1649800	1653800	And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told
1653800	1656240	us, we were told, here's what you should do.
1656240	1659840	Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you, and then by comparison
1659840	1660840	you won't care anymore.
1660840	1664720	You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people.
1664720	1668000	Yeah, so I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either
1668000	1670800	of the anxieties, in either case.
1670800	1674200	And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like,
1674200	1677720	you know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower who maybe
1677720	1680800	they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know I'm suffering
1680800	1683480	from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression.
1683480	1687160	And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you, don't be anxious about anything.
1687160	1688160	Thank you so much.
1688160	1693440	And they're like, well, don't be anxious, but in everything, in every situation by prayer
1693440	1695560	and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God.
1695560	1698480	And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that.
1698480	1702120	I guess I'm not supposed to have this because the solution to having anxiety is apparently
1702120	1703120	just don't.
1703120	1706600	And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal
1706640	1708800	with it as a shame thing because I'm not supposed to have it.
1708800	1712360	And so it never really gets dealt with at all.
1712360	1716920	The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level.
1716920	1721040	And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question, who's
1721040	1723160	in charge?
1723160	1726000	A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in
1726000	1727000	charge?
1727000	1730600	What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way, my feelings or my
1730600	1731680	thoughts are in charge.
1731680	1732680	I'm not in charge.
1732680	1733680	Not me.
1733680	1734680	I'm not in charge.
1735680	1737080	And this is where it starts.
1737080	1739080	This is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue.
1739080	1742360	In other words, probably another way to say it is this.
1742360	1743840	Anxiety has a double effect.
1743840	1746880	There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety,
1746880	1748160	to say it this way.
1748160	1752040	I'm freaking out about freaking out.
1752040	1754120	And this is why people get stuck in it.
1754120	1756600	It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough.
1756600	1760640	It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety, like what am I supposed to do with this thing
1760640	1764400	when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral and you maybe have this experience
1764480	1766760	or do you know people who do?
1766760	1768760	And here's what I want to do today.
1768760	1770480	I want to give us one tool.
1770480	1772040	It's not the answer to everything.
1772040	1773400	It doesn't solve all the anxiety.
1773400	1777960	It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool that also requires a pretty
1777960	1781320	significant amount of courage as well.
1781320	1785040	It's just going to, and just again, to make sure we reiterate, I'm not an expert.
1785040	1786680	Someone told you we're doing a series on anxiety.
1786680	1788720	You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure
1788720	1793280	about Jesus, but I will come hear that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on
1793280	1794280	this.
1795160	1795920	I'm not a therapist.
1795920	1796920	This is not my degree.
1796920	1798480	I'm a fellow traveler in this.
1798480	1800320	I do a little bit of research on some stuff.
1800320	1802280	I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing.
1802280	1804880	My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys.
1804880	1809040	But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today.
1809040	1811280	And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week.
1811280	1813600	But I also want to tell you this, fair warning.
1813600	1817560	The way we're going to get to this one tool is a very windy road.
1817560	1821920	Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes.
1821920	1823840	I don't appreciate the laughter.
1823840	1824840	It's fine.
1824840	1825840	It's fine.
1825840	1828680	But you're going to be like, what in the world are we doing?
1828680	1831200	And then I promise I will bring it back home.
1831200	1835240	But you're going to wonder for a little bit, because I'm going to start in a place you
1835240	1836240	may not expect.
1836240	1837800	And then we're going to get there.
1837800	1844840	So I'm going to start in ancient Near Eastern temple construction, because that's where
1844840	1845840	you thought I was going to go.
1845840	1846840	Right in here.
1846840	1847840	That's where we'll start.
1847840	1848840	Here's what we're going to do.
1848840	1849840	I'm totally serious.
1849840	1851680	Ancient Near Eastern temple construction.
1851680	1852680	Here's what happens.
1853040	1854800	The first of the phases starts like this.
1854800	1857000	It's the boundary making of a particular thing.
1857000	1858000	Here's where things are.
1858000	1859000	Here's where things are.
1859000	1862960	This separates the sacred space from the not-sacred space, boundary making.
1862960	1867520	Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filling of things and some further separation
1867520	1868520	of things.
1868520	1872600	There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces which are separated from other spaces.
1872600	1874280	All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East.
1874280	1879840	And the sixth phase of the temple construction, whatever it is, whatever god that's being
1879840	1883160	worshipped there, a statue typically is placed within there on the sixth phase.
1883160	1887400	So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation, sort of this creation
1887400	1888400	of a temple.
1888400	1893160	And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple to give people
1893160	1896880	an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple.
1896880	1901240	Now there are six days, there's a seven day creation, but there's a six day creation
1901240	1902240	narrative in the Bible.
1902240	1905080	Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation.
1905080	1908800	So god created mankind in his own image and the image of god, he created them male and
1908800	1909800	female.
1909800	1911240	This is the sixth day of creation.
1911240	1913120	Now let me pause right here for a second.
1913120	1919200	What's being said by this, many scholars agree, that the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation
1919200	1921880	narrative in the Bible, which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that
1921880	1925240	yet, that's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this, that the whole cosmos,
1925240	1928600	the Bible will say, is god's temple, the entire thing.
1928600	1933600	No temple could contain him, so the whole cosmos is his temple and instead of a statue
1933600	1939680	on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day, it's a person, people become the representation
1939680	1943760	of this god in his temple, the whole cosmos.
1943760	1947940	But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28.
1947940	1951200	God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth
1951200	1955160	and subdue it, some translations, and have dominion over it.
1955160	1960000	Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and over every living creature
1960000	1964160	that moves on the ground.
1964160	1968200	So the people aren't just simply decoration, there's more there, they're blessed and they're
1968200	1972600	told to multiply and have dominion and the answer to the question, who's in charge of
1972600	1974520	all of the created stuff?
1974520	1977460	The answer is, people are.
1977460	1981560	People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation.
1981560	1987760	In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to is God himself.
1987760	1990520	Other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things.
1990520	1993880	It's a gift to Genesis chapter two, where it gets a little bit more specific about some
1993880	1994880	of this stuff.
1994880	1998640	Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all
1998640	2003760	the birds of the sky, and he brought them to the man to see what he would name them.
2003760	2007240	And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
2007240	2011280	So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.
2011280	2014600	Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man, this created, this image of
2014600	2020600	God placed into this whole cosmos, which now has this responsibility to name everything.
2020600	2023160	Again, this might be a challenge for some of you, like I'm not sure I believe, just
2023280	2026760	stay with the point of what's happening here, because here's what's happening in naming.
2026760	2030480	Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible.
2030480	2033400	Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this, the first thing
2033400	2036320	that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing.
2036320	2041000	So when someone names a thing, it says, this is a that and I'm not that.
2041000	2042000	That's not me.
2042000	2046240	Over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is, from me, that's separate from
2046240	2047740	me.
2047740	2052600	Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me, does that make sense?
2052640	2055960	This is differentiation, you're different than me, that's what's being said, when we
2055960	2056960	name a thing.
2056960	2060960	Secondly, what happens in naming is sort of an authority over.
2060960	2065360	Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing.
2065360	2068440	So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not
2068440	2073040	me, but it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named.
2073040	2076920	This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament,
2076920	2080400	the Old Covenant, part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really
2080440	2083560	interesting kind of conversation about names.
2083560	2087480	Not least of which is the name of God, which is kind of, if you read Moses' interaction
2087480	2091440	with God in the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before, but one
2091440	2094720	of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool, what do I tell people your name is as if to
2094720	2097480	say, because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed.
2097480	2101820	It's so unbelievably important and sacred, in fact, to this day.
2101820	2107840	You will find very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God, they'll
2107880	2114880	refer to God as this word, Hashem, who is in that word simply means the name.
2115880	2120000	Like we can't even, we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God, because it's
2120000	2123840	so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment, so the word simply to describe
2123840	2127120	God is just the name.
2127120	2128600	Names are crucial.
2128600	2132800	Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible, but you know this, even nicknaming has rules.
2132800	2137120	Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up, maybe you still go by that nickname,
2137120	2140480	maybe introduce yourself as a particular name, maybe you know like, but there's some
2140480	2143040	rules that go along with that, you know that there's rules about that.
2143040	2147680	Now the first rule of nicknaming is, you don't get to choose your own nickname, you don't
2147680	2151840	get to decide, like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know, now I'm going
2151840	2157680	by MacGyver, kind of rhymes with McGuire, plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know,
2157680	2161480	like the gum and like a, you know, rubber band and he could like, oh look, let's fly
2161480	2162480	away and escape.
2162480	2166600	He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a, like a scuba tank, he could save
2166600	2168800	the world, you know, I was like, that's, that's me, I'm going by McGuire, you guys
2168800	2172400	are coming by McGyver now, woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work, that's not how
2172400	2176280	it goes, you can't choose your nickname, you don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed
2176280	2180240	upon you, and the way it always works is sort of a top-down method, either the leader, the
2180240	2184200	group of a person is like, you're now this, or the group decides, hey we've decided you're
2184200	2188000	going by this nickname, you'll get to choose it, you can't declare it, it's what we've
2188000	2191560	all decided because it's a top-down method, it's the way it works, it never gets to be
2191560	2195800	the other way, it's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of ascribing a nickname
2195880	2201760	to a person, and there's always, it tends to be, not always, but tends to be a moment
2201760	2205840	of like kind of mockery that's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of a little bit
2205840	2210000	funny but it's based in truth, it always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that,
2210000	2214560	you know, so I can never figure out, even to this day, why my 12-year-old soccer coach
2214560	2219360	called me lanky, I can't figure out what the truth was in there, I don't really know, that's
2219360	2222920	weird, anyway, so anyway, where was I going, now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your
2222960	2227240	own name, right, you guys watch Seinfeld and maybe you saw George try to be called T-Bone
2227240	2230840	and never really kind of panned out for him, the top-down method is how this works, remember
2230840	2234000	this, this is going to matter in a second, and there's always an element of sort of truth
2234000	2239200	and mockery that kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff, now, in Luke chapter 8,
2239200	2243240	Jesus encounters a man, this man is what we would call demonized, he's possessed by a
2243240	2248080	demon, and what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs, he doesn't
2248120	2253440	have a house, he's all by himself, now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late
2253440	2257760	modern world, we have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization
2257760	2262120	or demon possession, couple of different things, one of the things we tend to think, looking
2262120	2266320	back into the Bible as we go, look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis,
2266320	2269520	anytime anybody had something sort of, some sort of mental illness, they would just naturally
2269520	2274280	ascribe it to demon, oh, that's a demon, that's what that is, and I just want to say, you
2274960	2279320	might be right, but I also want to just propose something else, the Bible does talk about
2279320	2284160	a spiritual dimension of reality that is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on
2284160	2287680	a regular ongoing basis and sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that
2287680	2293160	are happening, and I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic,
2293160	2297200	people who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak,
2297200	2302160	and yet there is still in the Bible this description of things that where demons, spirit beings
2302240	2307960	are at work against what God is trying to do, and here's what I just want to say, the
2307960	2312840	one does not exclude the other, there is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose
2312840	2317120	back in the first century, and there is also demonic activity that's also at work, so I
2317120	2320040	just want to make sure we're all clear on that, are we okay moving forward with this?
2320040	2325080	Okay, good, here we go, now here's the scene, Luke 8, 26, they sailed to the regions of
2325080	2328680	the Jeresians which is across the lake from Galilee, so this is in the northern part of
2328720	2332920	Israel, there's two big lakes, there's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea,
2332920	2336080	Dead Sea's way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee's much more important because things live there,
2336080	2340200	and on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other
2340200	2345360	side, this is where people don't go very often, but when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a
2345360	2350000	demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a
2350000	2353360	house, but had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again, this is this person who lives
2353480	2358960	by himself naked in the tombs, and this man runs up to Jesus, and when he saw Jesus he cried out
2358960	2363040	and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what's important to keep in mind. When you
2363040	2366480	see this, and the story's also in Mark chapter 5, you can read this story, and one of the things
2366480	2371480	that's crucial when you see it is there's always this really difficult distinction between, it's
2371480	2375440	hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking, who's talking here, is the
2375440	2378960	demon or is it the guy, what I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of
2379040	2382720	keep it, it's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me.
2382720	2387360	Now, when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what do
2387360	2392880	you want with me Jesus, Son of the Most High God, I beg you don't torture me. So this is such an
2392880	2399040	interesting kind of encounter, some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon
2399840	2405120	is an attempt to gain control over Jesus, which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know
2405200	2409360	rule number two, it's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this,
2409360	2413920	this is what's going to be shown in a moment here, but there's this this sort of crying out of
2413920	2418240	Jesus's name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him, verse 29, for Jesus had commanded the
2418240	2422000	impure spirit to come out of the man, this is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence, like the
2422000	2426480	reason why this guy is saying this is because of this, so Luke is recording what happened, he's
2426480	2430880	like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever, is because
2430960	2434560	of this right here, for Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man,
2434560	2438560	and many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard,
2438560	2443120	he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places, let's pause here
2443120	2449520	for a second, so often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness,
2451520	2456800	so often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness, it isn't that the man
2456800	2460720	was like, oh man, I feel like I got a thing, I got a ghost, it's that the thing itself drove him
2461280	2472480	into the solitary places to be alone, then Jesus asked him, what is your name?
2477200	2481440	Legion, he replied, because many demons had gone into him, the word Legion to talk about a Roman
2481520	2487200	Legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers, so the idea of this means that there's
2487200	2496640	a ton of demonic activity in this particular person, what is your name? The question that's
2496640	2502720	being asked here is who's in charge, things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly
2502720	2508480	taking control of the moment, and Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to
2508480	2513760	fly in the face of the whole idea here, the demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus
2513760	2518560	because of, you know, he's able to like name him, what's being said here is that there is in fact
2518560	2524960	Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing and takes control of the moment, and then there's this
2524960	2529840	tragic comic kind of thing that happens next is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets
2529840	2535440	cast out into a herd of pigs which are nearby apparently, and then the pigs run into a lake
2535440	2540000	and drown, that's the story, they're like we're possessed, and they drown, that's it, I mean
2540000	2543200	that was a galloping pig by the way, if those of you guys are wondering that's what galloping pigs
2543200	2550320	look like, and they run away and they drown, now the question that you have which is a fair question
2550320	2558320	is what does this have to do with anybody's anxiety, let me tell you, one of the things that
2558320	2563360	happens in anxiety is this, one of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a
2563360	2567600	fusion, a linking and overlapping between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers
2567600	2572480	from anxiety or depression and that person themselves, they make it their identity, it's
2572480	2575360	one of the most tragic things that happens, one of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in
2575360	2581520	her own anxiety, her own anxiety journey, this is my wife, she said, I realized I had to stop
2581520	2585680	just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety, who I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm
2585680	2589600	always anxious, I'm anxious, she finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed,
2589600	2593120	maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious, this was something that was a problem that
2593120	2599200	needed to be addressed, fusing the two things together, Curtis Chang and his book which I
2599200	2602000	mentioned before and I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them or
2602000	2605760	take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know, no just kidding, but if you
2605760	2610240	want to borrow it it's fine, but we have a couple, his book's great but here's one of the things he
2610240	2615760	says to this very effect, when we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety
2615760	2621280	for extended periods, I love the language, we identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts
2621280	2627600	that our minds fuse with these thoughts, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we
2627600	2630800	play it over and over and over again, we talked about this last week about ruminating, the more we
2630800	2635360	rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa,
2637440	2643840	the more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads, the more we become indistinguishable
2643840	2649840	from that narrative, such that we cannot abandon those thoughts and this mental fusion can be so
2649840	2658480	complete we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked, in other words when we start
2658480	2662720	having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads and it starts
2662720	2671760	to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating, you can see where this is going,
2671760	2679040	we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us and find a way to rein
2679040	2692960	it in, so here's what we need to do, name it, name it, we have to call the thing whatever the
2692960	2698560	thing is we have to call it what it is so that we can separate it from ourselves, here's what Curtis
2698560	2704400	Chang says once again, when we can name our thoughts we recognize them as distinct from us
2705360	2711120	differentiation, we're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in
2711120	2716080	our minds but they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation,
2716080	2723920	there's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us,
2726320	2730720	when I named my anxious thoughts he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them,
2730800	2734160	the more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them,
2734800	2739200	the more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify, the more I watched those thoughts
2739200	2743040	with detached observation and not engagement and the more I said, oh I recognize you,
2743760	2754480	the more the anxious thoughts faded away, so let's call it what it is, we've got to name it,
2755440	2761200	we've got to name it and the question you have which is a fair question is, how do I name it,
2761200	2764400	I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do
2764400	2768480	with it and I just want to tell you again we're just going to look at kind of this is the very
2768480	2771760	beginning stages of stuff but let's just talk about this for a moment, one of the most helpful
2771760	2776160	ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in
2776160	2782960	your life, where are things not going smoothly, where's their friction, in other words take a
2782960	2787280	different way, can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated,
2787280	2790800	afraid, etc, where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing,
2792800	2797920	for instance if you're going through Del Taco and you're like they give you the wrong hot sauce
2797920	2801280	and you're like that's a bummer they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho and they
2801280	2806480	gave me regular old lame hot sauce and you're like that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response,
2806480	2809120	if you're like they didn't give me del scorcho I'm burning the place down,
2809760	2815600	by the way that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho okay but I'm just saying
2815600	2820160	that there's a moment where you're like that my response should be a two but it feels like it's
2820160	2824800	a 12, this is probably where you're going maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to
2824800	2828800	figure out what's going on here, there's a pattern where I'm overreacting it should be a two and I'm
2828800	2832720	giving it a 12 out of 10, something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for
2832720	2840800	all of us and they're all different kinds of scales, for me confession okay, I have to be very
2840800	2845680	very careful anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children
2851200	2854640	because there's a part of me and I've told you guys this before that if you're with us last week
2854640	2859360	I said the thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been
2859360	2863200	chasing me is this right here being a disappointment and being irrelevant these are the things that
2863200	2869200	come up with now in a competition anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser not just lose
2869200	2876640	but be a loser it's right into this stuff so I have a level of intensity with my own kids in
2876640	2884160	competition which is really I have to measure and some things I can't do whether it's like doing
2884160	2887440	things that's like an activity we do together like surfing it's like my kids are all better
2887440	2891760	surfers than me by a long shot but I'm like you know I just I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as
2891760	2896480	they are they're in there like my oldest is 20 he lives like it goes to school right next to the
2896480	2901360	beach he serves constantly he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes I'm like what's wrong with the
2901360	2905280	world anyway but he does that he's awesome and my other kids are incredible all the things they do
2905280	2908800	and I'm like I'm out and it's like I'm making it a competition and I have to win we're playing
2908800	2913760	cards we're playing horse and how much does it matter if I'm like playing horse with my son how
2913840	2921440	important is it that I win crucial is the answer to that question but it should be a two and it's
2921440	2925920	a 12 why does it matter I have to be very careful with these things where's their friction name it
2925920	2929680	you have to find some of the friction is probably one of the most helpful things you can do but
2929680	2932880	there's another layer to this and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult and it's
2932880	2936640	nonetheless crucial and by the way I have to apologize in advance is where I give you this
2936640	2942720	okay I'm gonna show you it in a second it rhymes okay and I always am afraid when it rhymes like
2942720	2946000	oh gosh we just packaged this up in a little neat little thing and there's probably a little
2946000	2949760	slight little tiny if you look closely a little tm on the top right of the circle around it like
2949760	2952800	trademark there's nothing I just want to make sure I want you to make sure you remember it
2953360	2957520	but for those of you guys that have a high like really sensitive cheese meter this is gonna set
2957520	2963680	you off okay it's very cheesy but it's really crucial okay so bear with me okay you guys you
2963680	2968080	guys ready for I think you can handle this okay so not only are we finding the friction where is
2968080	2972960	there this ongoing sort of pattern where I'm overreacting to certain things but bear with me
2972960	2980400	you probably what is more crucial than that is to find the fiction behind the friction I do not
2980400	2992640	appreciate that sir because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie behind every anxiety
2992720	2999360	that we feel is a near perfect lie like wow that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about
2999360	3002960	a particular thing and the thing that people that you may not be you but people that are around you
3002960	3007440	that might suffer from anxiety they're believing a particular lie that's being rehearsed over and
3007440	3012000	over again in their head and it's nearly perfect and the question we have to ask which is a very
3012000	3015760	courageous question which may require actual therapy you might have to go to a person who
3015760	3022800	can help you uncover this stuff but the point is there is 99 percent I'm gonna go 100 percent okay
3023520	3029040	there's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety there is a perfect lie behind
3029040	3035280	it and to ask the question where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial
3036880	3040480	behind the anxiety is a particular lie I showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down
3040480	3044240	and it's a lie let me give you some things to think about if you if you're having trouble kind of
3044240	3048000	identifying it this is not going to answer every question but maybe some of these you might connect
3048000	3053760	with okay here if blank happens it means I've lost control and when I lose control the whole world
3053760	3058640	goes it just whatever I just I have to be in control and if something happens it means I've
3058640	3064560	lost control it could be any number of things for you in can be small and it can be big it can be I
3064560	3068240	I'm late for dropping my kids off for school I'm late for picking up it could be I'm late for school
3068240	3072240	it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in it could be if I don't
3072240	3076720	connect with these people if I mess up my own if I don't get on Instagram enough times I don't see
3076720	3083600	these things it means I've lost control some of you might have this scenario there won't there
3083600	3088240	won't be enough I know what will happen there's just not going to be enough blank filling whatever
3088240	3094560	you want there money attention affection love I know that if I say yes to this now then there
3094560	3099520	won't be enough later or if this person says yes to this in my life there's only a certain there's
3099520	3103360	like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need and if they take a slice it's going to be
3103360	3107680	one less thing available for me or for anybody else or just won't be enough of whatever it is
3107680	3114720	you can maybe that's you some of you have this if I can't blank well whatever it is I'll be alone
3116560	3121760	if I can't do well as a student if I don't perform well at my job if I'm not a good friend if I
3121760	3126400	don't appear wonder if I don't do beauty well if I don't do personal health and fitness well
3126400	3131040	if I don't do living the California life well then I'll be all alone and people won't want me
3133360	3138320	that may be you some people have this one just connects with a lot of people
3138960	3145040	things are going so great but now what like I know everything's awesome but that only means
3145040	3149920	there's an impending doom right around the corner I feel like things are going great my
3149920	3152720	friendships are great maybe you're single and you got all your crew of friends you're like we're
3152720	3156800	getting along great and we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing
3157920	3161760	it's all gonna go it's something's gonna happen immediately maybe you're a person who's got a
3161760	3165440	mom group and you're all hanging out things are incredible you've got your kids and your marriages
3165440	3169200	are incredible and you're like it's just a it's a matter of time for everything goes away there's
3169200	3172240	going to be a disease there's going to be a volcano there's going to be something that
3172240	3176640	swallows us up we're all going to die I just know it there'll be a puddle on the way to church I mean
3176640	3180880	you know you never know a lot of people have this things are going great but they can't forever
3180880	3187040	just waiting for the thing the house of cards to fall that's an anxiety some people have this
3187040	3190960	that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do however I try to communicate
3190960	3195600	who I am I'll never be fully understood which is a matter of being not loved and being alone once
3195600	3198960	again I just cannot be an understood person and this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious
3198960	3207360	state some people have this what if we what if I or we never get through blank we're a tough
3207360	3211200	patch in our marriage I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life I want to meet the
3211200	3214720	I want to meet Mr. Right I want to meet Mrs. Right I want to be I want to be I want to be around
3214720	3218480	these bad what if I I but like I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it and
3218480	3221840	what if I don't get through what if we never get through it what if the tough spot of my marriage
3221840	3226640	or the disease or the illness I never get through it what if that never happens what I'm just preparing
3226640	3229760	myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel so what if I never
3229760	3237000	get through it. All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the
3237000	3242160	things that we're worried about and they generate for us a kind of anxiety about
3242160	3245720	this stuff and for some of you it may not be you like I said you may not be the
3245720	3248280	person who's got anxiety you may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all
3248280	3250480	that kind of stuff but you probably live with people and you're like why are they
3250480	3255560	reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2 because there's probably a fiction
3255560	3261560	behind it that's generating that sort of thing. Now what do we do with that? Now
3261560	3266640	this is really important depending this what we do with that depends really
3266640	3271760	crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus. You with me? Some of
3271760	3274760	you are like look I'm okay with Jesus I came because you're talking about anxiety
3274760	3278120	there's some cool stuff but I just want to tell you this is there's a dimension
3278120	3281160	that we're gonna talk about here which is so important to like understanding
3281160	3284720	what it is to walk with Jesus because there's a spiritual dimension to faith
3284720	3287160	it is not just practical help for all these kinds of things you go lots of
3287160	3290360	places to get that this is and we're okay with that by the way we're church
3290360	3294120	we're kind of okay with Jesus but I want to try to give you a sense of what we
3294120	3297320	talk about next that is gonna push this a little further and I think it's
3297320	3300000	probably what for some of you may be like an invitation to step into something
3300000	3304000	you've not yet considered but here's what I want to do remember when you look
3304000	3307360	back at this story Jesus with this demonized person this man who's naked
3307360	3313560	in the tombs it's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon Jesus doesn't need the
3313560	3315840	name to be able to take control which is really important to keep in mind but
3315840	3319920	Jesus extracts the name of the demon the demon says his own name Legion the guy
3319920	3324240	doesn't do it the demons one who drove him into isolation he's the demon he's
3324240	3327800	the naked demon guy living in the tombs doesn't live at home anymore and even the
3327800	3333880	guy couldn't name the thing Jesus has to draw it out of this person and maybe for
3333880	3336640	you when it comes to naming some of this stuff you actually need some
3336640	3341280	supernatural assistance to do it you actually need this is what Jesus really
3341320	3345960	can do and the inner stuff all this stuff it's hard requires courage and
3345960	3349800	humility and this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today
3349800	3355680	let's go back to Philippians 4 6 and 7 do not be anxious about anything but in
3355680	3358640	every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present request to
3358640	3361760	God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your
3361760	3364680	hearts and your minds and Christ Jesus what's so crucial to keep in mind is
3364680	3368320	every anxious person loves the second part of that the peace of God which
3368320	3371400	transcends understanding we all want that everybody even if you're not an
3371400	3374400	anxious person like that sounds great the peace of God which is beyond even my
3374400	3378840	understanding I want that but what I want to do today is this during everything
3378840	3386040	in mind I want to focus on this part of that verse prayer and petition when most
3386040	3389960	of us think about prayer we think about petition which is asking for a
3389960	3392860	particular thing petition means I'm asking for particularly you know it's
3392860	3396720	like it's the language of petitions in the First Amendment that we write to
3396720	3399320	petition the government is part of what's in there like that's actually
3399320	3403480	gets to ask for a particular thing to make something to make a request a formal
3403480	3406520	request of a thing which is part of what's being described here in fact even
3406520	3411240	it says make your request known to God but there's also something else there it
3411240	3415120	says prayer and petition which they're under the same umbrella but there's
3415120	3419440	something different about the two things which is worth thinking about because
3419440	3422480	for a lot of us all we think about is prayers while I ask God for stuff and
3422480	3425600	then hope he delivers and I'm ready for a couple different answers you know like
3425600	3428160	maybe you heard that growing up it's like yes you can have what you want no
3428160	3430960	you can't or you just have to wait around a little while it's like that's
3430960	3434200	all we know about prayer and I just want to say that there's there's a
3434200	3436680	beautiful part to that but I just want to kind of expand it a little bit
3436680	3441840	broader than that because maybe in prayer what we get to do is to seek God to do
3441840	3447280	something that's beyond asking him for stuff or to just simply solve a thing
3447280	3450880	one of the things we get to do in prayer is actually to ask God to reveal
3450920	3456680	something to us about us which means we're not asking we're just listening
3456680	3460000	in effect here's what the psalmist writes in Psalm 139 these famous words
3460000	3467000	search me God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if
3467000	3471640	there is any offensive some translations have the word hurtful way in me and lead
3471640	3479480	me in the way everlasting like there is some way through the anxiety to be led
3479480	3483880	in an everlasting and eternal kind of life not just forever like someday far
3483880	3488640	away but right now in the present to say it differently again another rhyming
3488640	3491840	thing please buckle your seatbelt I apologize but you need this okay stay
3491840	3497720	with me all healing whether it's like a medical like you broke your foot you
3497720	3502360	got an ear infection you got a heart condition all healing begins with
3502360	3508520	revealing we have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing
3508520	3512960	so that it can be addressed this is part of the naming process right and
3512960	3516320	it's scary because we have to see it for what it is so here's what I'm gonna do
3516320	3521440	I'm gonna give you a prayer it is a two-word prayer you can practice it
3521440	3524600	whenever you want however you want I'm gonna give you a rundown on how to do
3524600	3528440	it right now in a second but it's a two-word prayer that requires some
3528440	3531280	courage and it's different for a lot of you that maybe you haven't yet understood
3531280	3543280	what prayer is and here's what it looks like you ready search me search me there's
3543280	3546960	something that needs to be revealed to me that I can't find on my own to be
3546960	3551280	named so that I can differentiate it from myself and I need God to reveal it
3551280	3557160	in me with tenderness with care not with shame not with condemnation but with
3557160	3567240	love that gets drawn out so that in mind let's pray I'm gonna give you a moment
3567240	3574760	just as your eyes are closed to sit in the stillness of this if there is a
3574760	3580400	contrast between the loudness and the voices of anxiety it must be stillness
3580400	3593520	and silence Jesus search me
3610400	3632800	search me Jesus that I might find where there's friction
3640400	3655120	search me Jesus to uncover the lie the fiction that's undergirding that friction
3670960	3680120	when I can't name them what you name them my anxious thoughts Jesus
3680120	3696760	will you lead me in the way ever-lasting
3696760	3713440	Father would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you
3713440	3721720	in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives would you hear
3721720	3727840	your name the name that rescues that breaks through into the darkness Jesus
3727840	3736120	Jesus it is in your name that we pray Jesus amen
3751720	3760120	please bring it all to be the storm surrounding me
3760120	3773600	let it break and your name still call us it is still the rage you need is still
3773600	3776480	every way
3776480	3787080	and your name Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true
3787080	3800480	Jesus Jesus silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true
3800480	3807480	Jesus Jesus
3807480	3818480	we call these bones to live and call these lungs to sing once again
3818480	3828480	I will praise Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true
3828480	3842480	Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true
3842480	3867480	Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus
3867480	3883480	you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus you make the darkness
3883480	3904480	true Jesus Jesus you silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus
3904480	3912480	would you do this would you just stand together one of the things that you probably heard me say
3912480	3916480	this before if you've been around which is when we're singing we're setting our collective
3916480	3921480	prayer to music that's all we're doing and there's some real power in the prayer of people
3921480	3925480	being uttered at the same time in the same place there's something that happens in that
3925480	3929480	and I don't know how to explain it I just know that it does and so all I want us to do
3929480	3936480	is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices to sing that one more time together
3936480	3938480	and I'll close out our time so would you lead us in that
3938480	3957480	we sing Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus
3957480	3969480	you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus would you hold out your hands and would you just
3969480	3974480	receive this blessing where there is darkness that needs to tremble you can call in the name
3974480	3980480	of Jesus might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety
3980480	3989480	and depression and loneliness and isolation may you have the courage to utter the phrase
3989480	3996480	this week to God search me and know my anxious thoughts see if there's a hurtful way inside
3996480	4005480	of me and lead me in the way everlasting whatever you're up against may you know may it be conferred
4005480	4012480	upon you the love of the Father the grace of the Son and the fellowship and comfort of
4012480	4016480	the Holy Spirit in Jesus name so good to be with you amen so great to be together we'll
4016480	4017480	see you guys later
