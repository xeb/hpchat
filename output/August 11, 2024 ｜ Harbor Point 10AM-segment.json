Y'all, hey, oh, I love you too. I love you too. Y'all, I'm so grateful to be here today. This is an amazing church. So glad. I'm singing with my sister, Brittany, who is Kobe's wife. And she's singing for the first time in, what, four or five years? Jesus. Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back. We got the same alma mater in Ohio. And when I got my first job out of college, I was living with them in Houston, Texas. And they let me live there like a little brother for free, just trying to find my way. Somehow, I got myself out to California because of Kobe. And it's cool. Like, in this moment, I've been singing here and there here now. We're getting to lead and love God together again. So I'm so grateful for both of you. Love you, Kobe. Don't y'all love Kobe? I ain't going to say nothing smart this time. All right. Well, I love you too. And why don't you tell some people around you. I love you. And then you may have a seat. Hey, everyone, thanks for joining us today. We're so glad you're here.

We would love to see you in person for our at the movie series here at Harbor Point campus or the Regency Theater, but we thank you so much for joining us online today for our series on anxiety called A Bag of Angry Bees. All right, hey everybody, how's it going? Yeah, you guys chose, you chose the 10 o'clock service. You love traffic. You felt like it's raining. We could get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way. Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately, like how am I going to put to test the fact that I just learned something about Jesus, but to find a parking lot that's miserable and work my way out of it. And you did it. You found it. Way to go. Glad you guys made it. Those of you guys who are in the tent, glad you guys made it. Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as well. It is so good to be with you guys. And for those of you guys who are online, of course, we say this every single week. The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance to be together, because the people of our church are amazing. And really, you guys are. I'm really grateful to be with you guys. So fun. And I know you had to drive today through a puddle. You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car. And you made it. It's incredible. So great stuff happened. And let's get right to it. We have a lot to cover as we talk about this. By the way, if you're new with us, I'm Jeff, and I just want to make sure we're clear. We do not have all the answers. This is not a church. We have everything figured out. Here's what we know. We're looking at Jesus. We believe we were made with conviction for life with Jesus, and that requires everybody to help us along the way. Everybody's got a next step in that. So whether you're new, whether you're checking out Jesus, you're investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody's got a next step to take. And our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don't have it all together. We're a work in progress kind of people doing that stuff. So however that is, grateful that you're here. Let's get right to it. I'm going to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just pay attention as you watch this commercial. Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you're an old person, okay? But I recognize it, it's fine. But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this commercial. Check this out, okay? Here we go. Mary Clary, thanks for her zipper bags are the best, and we'll never switch to Gladlock zipper bags. That's right, never. And Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here with either your bag filled with angry bees or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees? See that green color chain seal there, Mary? That shows you the Gladlock bag is closed. Your bag doesn't have a green seal. You know, change is good. I'll take the Gladlock zipper bag. Just kidding, Mary. When it really counts, don't get mad. Get Gladlock zipper bags. Okay, some of you remember this commercial. Now, what I want to, obviously this is, it's a goofy commercial, and I'll help you by over analyzing it and taking it way too seriously, okay? That's the gift I bring. But let's look at this for a moment. This ad is a question about which bag, it's a question about bag choice. Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue seal, which makes the green thing, which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial. And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag would you rather have hold the angry bees that we're going to give you? And secondly, we're going to put you into this phone booth, which you've somehow agreed to do this. The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea that these people who are making this scenario happen not only have they got bees to give a person to hold, but also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone booth. And for those of you who don't know what a phone booth is, it's like an elevator that doesn't go anywhere. That's all that it is. It's the same thing. It's not a phone, but it's in a tiny little space and nobody else joins you in there. But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth to which they're agreeing to do. And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody? How is she not like, why don't you just take all the bees and go away? I don't want to do any of this. I don't care what bag you use. I'm not doing this. This whole thing is stupid. The power dynamic, everything, like I'm going to convince her and we're going to lock her in this thing. How is she not just like, no, I'm not doing that? The question is, and why are people saying yes to this? The question over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I'm taking it too seriously. The question is, well, who's in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea? Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking them and handing them to a person and says, then we're going to lock you in a phone booth. The whole thing is bizarre and absurd and who's in charge here? Now that question, who's in charge here, is a critical question when it comes to anxiety. Who's in charge here? We're in week two of a series called the bag of angry bees and it's a series on anxiety because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry bees. But I want to catch us up a little bit. If you weren't here last week and make sure we're all in the same sort of playing field as we talk about this idea of anxiety, one of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate between fear and anxiety. Fear is the response to something that has happened, like bear, person with a knife coming after us. Oh my gosh, that's fear. Anxiety is what if there's a bear, what if we go there and there's a person with a knife? That's anxiety. Are you with me? One's anticipating a thing, one is responding to a particular thing. And we said that generally what happens when we're talking about anxiety is that the thing that's happening or even the thing that's a concern is a reasonable concern but in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level. Are you with me? Now, we also said this, it's so important to keep in mind that all anxieties have something in common. Anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty. It's about a low tolerance for things that are not certain. And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically all of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety. It's one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most current statistics on this, which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have someone in your house perhaps, or you yourself as someone who has anxiety. And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where you grew up or what kind of healthy environment you might have encountered, some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have anxiety, the best solution is simply as people have told us or we've understood is simply snap out of it. Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don't, just get over it. It's a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff, compensate by being high functioning and just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it because you shouldn't have to deal with it, just snap out of it. And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone told us, we were told, here's what you should do. Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you, and then by comparison you won't care anymore. You know, there's conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it's pretty anxious for those people. Yeah, so I guess I don't get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either of the anxieties, in either case. And if you're a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who's like, you know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who's a Jesus follower who maybe they're a little misguided, but you're like, hey, I just want to let you know I'm suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression. And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you, don't be anxious about anything. Thank you so much. And they're like, well, don't be anxious, but in everything, in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God. And you're just like, well, I don't know what you're supposed to do with that. I guess I'm not supposed to have this because the solution to having anxiety is apparently just don't. And if I don't know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away and deal with it as a shame thing because I'm not supposed to have it. And so it never really gets dealt with at all. The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level. And here's what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question, who's in charge? A person who's suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey, who's in charge? What they would say is, and again, I'm paraphrasing, but to say it this way, my feelings or my thoughts are in charge. I'm not in charge. Not me. I'm not in charge. And this is where it starts. This is where anxiety begins to become kind of an issue. In other words, probably another way to say it is this. Anxiety has a double effect. There's the anxiety that we feel, and then there's the way we feel about our anxiety, to say it this way. I'm freaking out about freaking out. And this is why people get stuck in it. It's not just that I'm freaking out as if that was enough. It's that now I have anxiety about my anxiety, like what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can't control and all of it starts to spiral and you maybe have this experience or do you know people who do? And here's what I want to do today. I want to give us one tool. It's not the answer to everything. It doesn't solve all the anxiety. It's just one really underutilized, very accessible tool that also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well. It's just going to, and just again, to make sure we reiterate, I'm not an expert. Someone told you we're doing a series on anxiety. You might have thought you're like, maybe you're new and you're like, I'm not sure about Jesus, but I will come hear that and you thought, they told you I'm an expert on this. I'm not a therapist. This is not my degree. I'm a fellow traveler in this. I do a little bit of research on some stuff. I'm looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing. My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys. But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today. And it's kind of a next step building on what we did last week. But I also want to tell you this, fair warning. The way we're going to get to this one tool is a very windy road. Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes. I don't appreciate the laughter. It's fine. It's fine. But you're going to be like, what in the world are we doing? And then I promise I will bring it back home. But you're going to wonder for a little bit, because I'm going to start in a place you may not expect. And then we're going to get there. So I'm going to start in ancient Near Eastern temple construction, because that's where you thought I was going to go. Right in here. That's where we'll start. Here's what we're going to do. I'm totally serious. Ancient Near Eastern temple construction. Here's what happens. The first of the phases starts like this. It's the boundary making of a particular thing. Here's where things are. Here's where things are. This separates the sacred space from the not-sacred space, boundary making. Then after things are sort of put up, there's some filling of things and some further separation of things. There's either, sometimes there's interior spaces which are separated from other spaces. All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East. And the sixth phase of the temple construction, whatever it is, whatever god that's being worshipped there, a statue typically is placed within there on the sixth phase. So there's typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation, sort of this creation of a temple. And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple to give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple. Now there are six days, there's a seven day creation, but there's a six day creation narrative in the Bible. Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation. So god created mankind in his own image and the image of god, he created them male and female. This is the sixth day of creation. Now let me pause right here for a second. What's being said by this, many scholars agree, that the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible, which some of you are like, I'm not sure I'm buying into that yet, that's okay, don't worry about it, just stay with me on this, that the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god's temple, the entire thing. No temple could contain him, so the whole cosmos is his temple and instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day, it's a person, people become the representation of this god in his temple, the whole cosmos. But the people aren't just a decoration, there's more, verse 28. God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth and subdue it, some translations, and have dominion over it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground. So the people aren't just simply decoration, there's more there, they're blessed and they're told to multiply and have dominion and the answer to the question, who's in charge of all of the created stuff? The answer is, people are. People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation. In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to is God himself. Other than that, they're supposed to be over all of these things. It's a gift to Genesis chapter two, where it gets a little bit more specific about some of this stuff. Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky, and he brought them to the man to see what he would name them. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals. Notice what's happening here, there's something about this man, this created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos, which now has this responsibility to name everything. Again, this might be a challenge for some of you, like I'm not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what's happening here, because here's what's happening in naming. Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible. Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this, the first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing. So when someone names a thing, it says, this is a that and I'm not that. That's not me. Over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is, from me, that's separate from me. Those are animals, I'm not, that's animals, I'm me, does that make sense? This is differentiation, you're different than me, that's what's being said, when we name a thing. Secondly, what happens in naming is sort of an authority over. Probably better said is it implies they're taking responsibility for a thing. So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I'm not that, that's not me, but it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named. This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, the Old Covenant, part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting kind of conversation about names. Not least of which is the name of God, which is kind of, if you read Moses' interaction with God in the burning bush story, perhaps you've heard of that story before, but one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool, what do I tell people your name is as if to say, because it's a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed. It's so unbelievably important and sacred, in fact, to this day. You will find very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God, they'll refer to God as this word, Hashem, who is in that word simply means the name. Like we can't even, we don't even want to whisper, say the name of God, because it's so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment, so the word simply to describe God is just the name. Names are crucial. Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible, but you know this, even nicknaming has rules. Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up, maybe you still go by that nickname, maybe introduce yourself as a particular name, maybe you know like, but there's some rules that go along with that, you know that there's rules about that. Now the first rule of nicknaming is, you don't get to choose your own nickname, you don't get to decide, like I don't get to say, you guys just want to let you know, now I'm going by MacGyver, kind of rhymes with McGuire, plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum and like a, you know, rubber band and he could like, oh look, let's fly away and escape. He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a, like a scuba tank, he could save the world, you know, I was like, that's, that's me, I'm going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now, woo, I'm just going, you know that doesn't work, that's not how it goes, you can't choose your nickname, you don't get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you, and the way it always works is sort of a top-down method, either the leader, the group of a person is like, you're now this, or the group decides, hey we've decided you're going by this nickname, you'll get to choose it, you can't declare it, it's what we've all decided because it's a top-down method, it's the way it works, it never gets to be the other way, it's always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of ascribing a nickname to a person, and there's always, it tends to be, not always, but tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery that's based in truth a little bit, like it's sort of a little bit funny but it's based in truth, it always sort of connects, there's a dotted line to that, you know, so I can never figure out, even to this day, why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky, I can't figure out what the truth was in there, I don't really know, that's weird, anyway, so anyway, where was I going, now, nicknaming, you don't get to choose your own name, right, you guys watch Seinfeld and maybe you saw George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him, the top-down method is how this works, remember this, this is going to matter in a second, and there's always an element of sort of truth and mockery that kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff, now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man, this man is what we would call demonized, he's possessed by a demon, and what you see with this man is he's naked, he's living in the tombs, he doesn't have a house, he's all by himself, now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world, we have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization or demon possession, couple of different things, one of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go, look, they don't have sophisticated psychological analysis, anytime anybody had something sort of, some sort of mental illness, they would just naturally ascribe it to demon, oh, that's a demon, that's what that is, and I just want to say, you might be right, but I also want to just propose something else, the Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality that is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular ongoing basis and sort of are visible, or there's an unseen world of things that are happening, and I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic, people who suffer from mental illness aren't necessarily being demonized, so to speak, and yet there is still in the Bible this description of things that where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do, and here's what I just want to say, the one does not exclude the other, there is mental illness that they don't know how to diagnose back in the first century, and there is also demonic activity that's also at work, so I just want to make sure we're all clear on that, are we okay moving forward with this? Okay, good, here we go, now here's the scene, Luke 8, 26, they sailed to the regions of the Jeresians which is across the lake from Galilee, so this is in the northern part of Israel, there's two big lakes, there's the Sea of Galilee and then there's the Dead Sea, Dead Sea's way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee's much more important because things live there, and on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called the other side, this is where people don't go very often, but when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again, this is this person who lives by himself naked in the tombs, and this man runs up to Jesus, and when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what's important to keep in mind. When you see this, and the story's also in Mark chapter 5, you can read this story, and one of the things that's crucial when you see it is there's always this really difficult distinction between, it's hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking, who's talking here, is the demon or is it the guy, what I want you to see is I think that's kind of important to kind of keep it, it's important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay, with me. Now, when he saw Jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice, what do you want with me Jesus, Son of the Most High God, I beg you don't torture me. So this is such an interesting kind of encounter, some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon is an attempt to gain control over Jesus, which of course fails miserably because he doesn't know rule number two, it's a top-down model, you can't, Jesus is over everything, you can't do this, this is what's going to be shown in a moment here, but there's this this sort of crying out of Jesus's name as an attempt perhaps to gain control over him, verse 29, for Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man, this is what's sort of like an out-of-order sentence, like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this, so Luke is recording what happened, he's like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don't torture us or whatever, is because of this right here, for Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man, and many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places, let's pause here for a second, so often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness, so often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness, it isn't that the man was like, oh man, I feel like I got a thing, I got a ghost, it's that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone, then Jesus asked him, what is your name? Legion, he replied, because many demons had gone into him, the word Legion to talk about a Roman Legion is about roughly five to six thousand Roman soldiers, so the idea of this means that there's a ton of demonic activity in this particular person, what is your name? The question that's being asked here is who's in charge, things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of the moment, and Jesus doesn't need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face of the whole idea here, the demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know, he's able to like name him, what's being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over the whole thing and takes control of the moment, and then there's this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs which are nearby apparently, and then the pigs run into a lake and drown, that's the story, they're like we're possessed, and they drown, that's it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way, if those of you guys are wondering that's what galloping pigs look like, and they run away and they drown, now the question that you have which is a fair question is what does this have to do with anybody's anxiety, let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this, one of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a linking and overlapping between the thing that's afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression and that person themselves, they make it their identity, it's one of the most tragic things that happens, one of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety, her own anxiety journey, this is my wife, she said, I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety, who I'm an anxious person, I'm just anxious, I'm always anxious, I'm anxious, she finally had to realize maybe that wasn't the way I was supposed, maybe I wasn't made, God didn't make me anxious, this was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed, fusing the two things together, Curtis Chang and his book which I mentioned before and I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we'll know, no just kidding, but if you want to borrow it it's fine, but we have a couple, his book's great but here's one of the things he says to this very effect, when we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended periods, I love the language, we identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these thoughts, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and over again, we talked about this last week about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa, the more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads, the more we become indistinguishable from that narrative, such that we cannot abandon those thoughts and this mental fusion can be so complete we sometimes don't even recognize that we've been hijacked, in other words when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over and over and over again in our heads and it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating, you can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the affliction that is upon us and find a way to rein it in, so here's what we need to do, name it, name it, we have to call the thing whatever the thing is we have to call it what it is so that we can separate it from ourselves, here's what Curtis Chang says once again, when we can name our thoughts we recognize them as distinct from us differentiation, we're meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in our minds but they're not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation, there's a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought becoming us, when I named my anxious thoughts he says, I began to experience a sense of authority over them, the more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them, the more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify, the more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement and the more I said, oh I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded away, so let's call it what it is, we've got to name it, we've got to name it and the question you have which is a fair question is, how do I name it, I just feel like I'm freaking out, I don't know how to name this thing, what am I supposed to do with it and I just want to tell you again we're just going to look at kind of this is the very beginning stages of stuff but let's just talk about this for a moment, one of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to do this, is to find where there is friction in your life, where are things not going smoothly, where's their friction, in other words take a different way, can you identify a pattern in your life where you're regularly agitated, afraid, etc, where there's probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing, for instance if you're going through Del Taco and you're like they give you the wrong hot sauce and you're like that's a bummer they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a del scorcho and they gave me regular old lame hot sauce and you're like that's a bummer, that's an appropriate response, if you're like they didn't give me del scorcho I'm burning the place down, by the way that's a serious offense when you don't get del scorcho okay but I'm just saying that there's a moment where you're like that my response should be a two but it feels like it's a 12, this is probably where you're going maybe there's something in here where I'm trying to figure out what's going on here, there's a pattern where I'm overreacting it should be a two and I'm giving it a 12 out of 10, something's a problem here and there's different triggering events for all of us and they're all different kinds of scales, for me confession okay, I have to be very very careful anytime I'm in any kind of competition with my children because there's a part of me and I've told you guys this before that if you're with us last week I said the thing that I've been naming recently over the course of my life is that what's been chasing me is this right here being a disappointment and being irrelevant these are the things that come up with now in a competition anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser not just lose but be a loser it's right into this stuff so I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition which is really I have to measure and some things I can't do whether it's like doing things that's like an activity we do together like surfing it's like my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot but I'm like you know I just I'm frustrated that I'm not as good as they are they're in there like my oldest is 20 he lives like it goes to school right next to the beach he serves constantly he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes I'm like what's wrong with the world anyway but he does that he's awesome and my other kids are incredible all the things they do and I'm like I'm out and it's like I'm making it a competition and I have to win we're playing cards we're playing horse and how much does it matter if I'm like playing horse with my son how important is it that I win crucial is the answer to that question but it should be a two and it's a 12 why does it matter I have to be very careful with these things where's their friction name it you have to find some of the friction is probably one of the most helpful things you can do but there's another layer to this and this is where it gets even a little bit more difficult and it's nonetheless crucial and by the way I have to apologize in advance is where I give you this okay I'm gonna show you it in a second it rhymes okay and I always am afraid when it rhymes like oh gosh we just packaged this up in a little neat little thing and there's probably a little slight little tiny if you look closely a little tm on the top right of the circle around it like trademark there's nothing I just want to make sure I want you to make sure you remember it but for those of you guys that have a high like really sensitive cheese meter this is gonna set you off okay it's very cheesy but it's really crucial okay so bear with me okay you guys you guys ready for I think you can handle this okay so not only are we finding the friction where is there this ongoing sort of pattern where I'm overreacting to certain things but bear with me you probably what is more crucial than that is to find the fiction behind the friction I do not appreciate that sir because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie like wow that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular thing and the thing that people that you may not be you but people that are around you that might suffer from anxiety they're believing a particular lie that's being rehearsed over and over again in their head and it's nearly perfect and the question we have to ask which is a very courageous question which may require actual therapy you might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff but the point is there is 99 percent I'm gonna go 100 percent okay there's a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety there is a perfect lie behind it and to ask the question where is the lie that's fueling this kind of anxiety is crucial behind the anxiety is a particular lie I showed you kind of my own thing that's chasing me down and it's a lie let me give you some things to think about if you if you're having trouble kind of identifying it this is not going to answer every question but maybe some of these you might connect with okay here if blank happens it means I've lost control and when I lose control the whole world goes it just whatever I just I have to be in control and if something happens it means I've lost control it could be any number of things for you in can be small and it can be big it can be I I'm late for dropping my kids off for school I'm late for picking up it could be I'm late for school it could be if I screw up a homework assignment that I'm supposed to turn in it could be if I don't connect with these people if I mess up my own if I don't get on Instagram enough times I don't see these things it means I've lost control some of you might have this scenario there won't there won't be enough I know what will happen there's just not going to be enough blank filling whatever you want there money attention affection love I know that if I say yes to this now then there won't be enough later or if this person says yes to this in my life there's only a certain there's like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that I need and if they take a slice it's going to be one less thing available for me or for anybody else or just won't be enough of whatever it is you can maybe that's you some of you have this if I can't blank well whatever it is I'll be alone if I can't do well as a student if I don't perform well at my job if I'm not a good friend if I don't appear wonder if I don't do beauty well if I don't do personal health and fitness well if I don't do living the California life well then I'll be all alone and people won't want me that may be you some people have this one just connects with a lot of people things are going so great but now what like I know everything's awesome but that only means there's an impending doom right around the corner I feel like things are going great my friendships are great maybe you're single and you got all your crew of friends you're like we're getting along great and we have this community of people that we get to be around and it's so amazing it's all gonna go it's something's gonna happen immediately maybe you're a person who's got a mom group and you're all hanging out things are incredible you've got your kids and your marriages are incredible and you're like it's just a it's a matter of time for everything goes away there's going to be a disease there's going to be a volcano there's going to be something that swallows us up we're all going to die I just know it there'll be a puddle on the way to church I mean you know you never know a lot of people have this things are going great but they can't forever just waiting for the thing the house of cards to fall that's an anxiety some people have this that there's a sense that I'll never be understood no matter what I do however I try to communicate who I am I'll never be fully understood which is a matter of being not loved and being alone once again I just cannot be an understood person and this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state some people have this what if we what if I or we never get through blank we're a tough patch in our marriage I'm in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life I want to meet the I want to meet Mr. Right I want to meet Mrs. Right I want to be I want to be I want to be around these bad what if I I but like I'm in this tough spot of loneliness and I can't get through it and what if I don't get through what if we never get through it what if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness I never get through it what if that never happens what I'm just preparing myself to never get through because I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel so what if I never get through it. All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we're worried about and they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff and for some of you it may not be you like I said you may not be the person who's got anxiety you may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff but you probably live with people and you're like why are they reacting like a 12 when it should be a 2 because there's probably a fiction behind it that's generating that sort of thing. Now what do we do with that? Now this is really important depending this what we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you perceive Jesus. You with me? Some of you are like look I'm okay with Jesus I came because you're talking about anxiety there's some cool stuff but I just want to tell you this is there's a dimension that we're gonna talk about here which is so important to like understanding what it is to walk with Jesus because there's a spiritual dimension to faith it is not just practical help for all these kinds of things you go lots of places to get that this is and we're okay with that by the way we're church we're kind of okay with Jesus but I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next that is gonna push this a little further and I think it's probably what for some of you may be like an invitation to step into something you've not yet considered but here's what I want to do remember when you look back at this story Jesus with this demonized person this man who's naked in the tombs it's Jesus who extracts the name of the demon Jesus doesn't need the name to be able to take control which is really important to keep in mind but Jesus extracts the name of the demon the demon says his own name Legion the guy doesn't do it the demons one who drove him into isolation he's the demon he's the naked demon guy living in the tombs doesn't live at home anymore and even the guy couldn't name the thing Jesus has to draw it out of this person and maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff you actually need some supernatural assistance to do it you actually need this is what Jesus really can do and the inner stuff all this stuff it's hard requires courage and humility and this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today let's go back to Philippians 4 6 and 7 do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving present request to God and the peace of God which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds and Christ Jesus what's so crucial to keep in mind is every anxious person loves the second part of that the peace of God which transcends understanding we all want that everybody even if you're not an anxious person like that sounds great the peace of God which is beyond even my understanding I want that but what I want to do today is this during everything in mind I want to focus on this part of that verse prayer and petition when most of us think about prayer we think about petition which is asking for a particular thing petition means I'm asking for particularly you know it's like it's the language of petitions in the First Amendment that we write to petition the government is part of what's in there like that's actually gets to ask for a particular thing to make something to make a request a formal request of a thing which is part of what's being described here in fact even it says make your request known to God but there's also something else there it says prayer and petition which they're under the same umbrella but there's something different about the two things which is worth thinking about because for a lot of us all we think about is prayers while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers and I'm ready for a couple different answers you know like maybe you heard that growing up it's like yes you can have what you want no you can't or you just have to wait around a little while it's like that's all we know about prayer and I just want to say that there's there's a beautiful part to that but I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that because maybe in prayer what we get to do is to seek God to do something that's beyond asking him for stuff or to just simply solve a thing one of the things we get to do in prayer is actually to ask God to reveal something to us about us which means we're not asking we're just listening in effect here's what the psalmist writes in Psalm 139 these famous words search me God and know my heart test me and know my anxious thoughts see if there is any offensive some translations have the word hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting like there is some way through the anxiety to be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life not just forever like someday far away but right now in the present to say it differently again another rhyming thing please buckle your seatbelt I apologize but you need this okay stay with me all healing whether it's like a medical like you broke your foot you got an ear infection you got a heart condition all healing begins with revealing we have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we're facing so that it can be addressed this is part of the naming process right and it's scary because we have to see it for what it is so here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna give you a prayer it is a two-word prayer you can practice it whenever you want however you want I'm gonna give you a rundown on how to do it right now in a second but it's a two-word prayer that requires some courage and it's different for a lot of you that maybe you haven't yet understood what prayer is and here's what it looks like you ready search me search me there's something that needs to be revealed to me that I can't find on my own to be named so that I can differentiate it from myself and I need God to reveal it in me with tenderness with care not with shame not with condemnation but with love that gets drawn out so that in mind let's pray I'm gonna give you a moment just as your eyes are closed to sit in the stillness of this if there is a contrast between the loudness and the voices of anxiety it must be stillness and silence Jesus search me search me Jesus that I might find where there's friction search me Jesus to uncover the lie the fiction that's undergirding that friction when I can't name them what you name them my anxious thoughts Jesus will you lead me in the way ever-lasting Father would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives would you hear your name the name that rescues that breaks through into the darkness Jesus Jesus it is in your name that we pray Jesus amen please bring it all to be the storm surrounding me let it break and your name still call us it is still the rage you need is still every way and your name Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus we call these bones to live and call these lungs to sing once again I will praise Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus you silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus would you do this would you just stand together one of the things that you probably heard me say this before if you've been around which is when we're singing we're setting our collective prayer to music that's all we're doing and there's some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same time in the same place there's something that happens in that and I don't know how to explain it I just know that it does and so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices to sing that one more time together and I'll close out our time so would you lead us in that we sing Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus the silence fear Jesus Jesus you make the darkness true Jesus Jesus would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing where there is darkness that needs to tremble you can call in the name of Jesus might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety and depression and loneliness and isolation may you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God search me and know my anxious thoughts see if there's a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting whatever you're up against may you know may it be conferred upon you the love of the Father the grace of the Son and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit in Jesus name so good to be with you amen so great to be together we'll see you guys later", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " Good morning, Harbour Point, come on,
