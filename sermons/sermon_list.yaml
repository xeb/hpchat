  transcript: 'Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you
    stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

    Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ.
    Come on, put those hands.

    Let''s sing.

    If you believe, won''t you put them together?

    Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

    By His blood, I have been severed.

    I believe in resurrection.

    Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

    Let''s sing all praise.

    Hallelujah, yes I do.

    Hallelujah, I believe in Him.

    I believe in the hope of heaven.

    He''s preparing the place for me.

    Far beyond my heart''s imagine.

    Here''s a bird and night I see.

    I believe that He''s going.

    His return is to blame, it''s bright.

    Light the altar, keep it burning.

    See the light, the rose of holy light, yeah.

    All praise to the Father.

    All praise to Christ the Son.

    All praise to the Holy Spirit.

    Our God has overblown.

    The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe, yeah.

    I believe in You, Lord, and I trust You.

    I believe in You, though I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

    How could I ever walk away?

    Will the Word have saved my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    No, I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus.

    How could I ever walk away?

    From the Word who saves my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    No, I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

    How could I ever walk away?

    From the Word who saves my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    All praise to the Father.

    All praise to Christ the Son.

    All praise to the Holy Spirit.

    Our God has overblown.

    The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

    I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

    I believe in you.

    How can you believe in Jesus today?

    Won''t you give him some praise?

    We serve a God that is more than able.

    Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

    abundantly, how baffled we can ask for things.

    Continue on our worship and sing unto the Lord.

    We trust you to depend on the Lord.

    The Son.

    When did I start to forgive?

    All of the great things you did.

    And when did I throw away my faith for Him?

    In the gospel of love?

    And how did I start to believe?

    You were to fish and fall.

    And why do I talk my sick?

    How can I forgive you?

    How can you believe in God?

    You are more than able.

    You are more than able.

    Stay it again.

    You are more than able.

    Oh, hear the people today,

    waiting loud.

    You are more than able.

    So who art to deny what the Lord can do?

    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
    oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

    oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    oh

    More than able to rely, to deny what the Lord can do

    Can''t you imagine?

    And all of the faith in the room, what the Lord can do

    What the Lord can do

    Yeah, it''s gonna happen

    Just like the way we make it through

    It''s gonna load

    It''s gonna load

    Can''t you imagine?

    Can''t you imagine?

    With all of the faith in the room

    What the Lord can do

    What the Lord can do

    And it''s gonna happen

    Just like the way we make it through

    It''s gonna load

    Anything is possible

    We declare it today

    Anything is possible

    So you and I, to deny what the Lord can do

    Yeah, it''s easy for you

    I believe in you

    See, you are more than people

    Why don''t you close your eyes and sing that

    It''s a place of faith to sing

    So you are more than people

    You are more than people

    We trust you are

    You are more than people

    Who am I to deny what the Lord can do

    Yes, Jesus

    It''s called You Keep Hope Alive

    It''s very easy

    So I''m gonna teach you first

    But it''s all proclaiming the hope that is in Jesus

    Because we have hope in Him

    Hope to live for tomorrow

    Let''s stand in this world

    Let''s sing this

    Sing

    Day makes me darkest

    But your light is greater

    You will light our way

    God, you will light our way

    And with evil it''s rising

    You''re rising higher

    With power to save

    With power to save

    I''m gonna teach you

    You keep hope alive

    You keep hope alive

    From the beginning to when

    Your word never fails

    And your light is stronger

    You''re always strong

    Liberator rose up from the red

    In the middle of the storm

    You''re standing right there with me

    In the middle of the fog

    You keep hope alive

    Thank you, Lord

    If my grandma was here and she wouldn''t sing it like this

    She would say, because she lives

    I can face tomorrow

    Because Jesus lives

    All of my fears, they''re gone

    Because I know

    I know, I know

    He holds you in His future

    In life

    It''s worth living just

    Because Jesus lives

    It''s an old song, old song

    I''m 33, but I got an old soul

    I love those songs, you know

    Can I say one more time, just receive it

    Receive it, let it encourage your spirit

    Back in the black church, we just used to sing songs

    When people get excited, because it was the truth

    Because He lives

    Someone needs to hear that

    I can face tomorrow

    Because Jesus lives

    All of my fears, they are gone

    They are gone

    Because I know

    I know, I know

    He holds my future in

    Life isn''t worth

    I don''t have to give up

    It''s worth living just

    Because you are my Savior

    He lives

    If you know He lives, that''s right

    Give the Lord some praise

    My life is worth living because He lives

    Because Jesus lives

    I''m gonna leave that alone before I start running

    Welcome to Harbor Point, how y''all doing?

    Yeah

    I know y''all wondering again

    This man is shouting at me again

    Y''all black dude, you gotta get off the stage

    Y''all, hey, I love you too

    I love you too

    Y''all, I''m so grateful to be here today

    This is an amazing church, so glad

    I''m singing with my sister Brittany

    Who is Kobe''s wife

    And she''s singing for the first time

    In what, four or five years?

    Jesus

    Me and Kobe and Brittany, we go way back

    We got the same alma mater in Ohio

    And when I got my first job out of college

    I was living with them in Houston, Texas

    And they let me live there like a little brother

    For free, just trying to find my way

    Somehow, I got myself out to California

    Because of Kobe

    And it''s cool, like in this moment

    I''ve been singing here and there, here and now

    We''re getting to lead and love God together

    Again, so I''m so grateful for both of you

    Love you, Kobe, don''t y''all love Kobe?

    I ain''t gonna say nothing smart this time

    Alright, well, I love you too

    And why don''t you tell some people around you

    I love you, and then you may have a seat

    Okay

    called

    A Back of Angry Beasts

    Alright, hey everybody, how''s it going?

    Yeah, you guys chose a 10 o''clock service, you love traffic, you feel like it''s
    raining

    We can get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way

    Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately

    Like, how am I gonna put to test the fact that I just learned something about
    Jesus

    But to find a parking lot that''s miserable and work my way out of it

    And you did it, you found it, way to go

    Glad you guys made it, those of you guys are in the tent, glad you guys made it

    Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as
    well

    It is so good to be with you guys and for those of you guys who are online

    Of course, we say this every single week

    The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance
    to be together

    Because the people of our church are amazing, and really you guys are

    I''m really grateful to be with you guys, so fun

    If you''re, and I know you had to drive today through a puddle

    You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car

    And you made it, it''s incredible, so great stuff happening, let''s get right
    to it

    We have a lot to cover as we talk about this

    By the way, if you''re new with us, I''m Jeff and I just want to make sure we''re
    clear

    We do not have all the answers, this is not a church where we have everything
    figured out

    Here''s what we know, we''re looking at Jesus, we believe we were made with conviction
    for life with Jesus

    And that requires everybody to help us along the way

    Everybody''s got a next step in that, so whether you''re new, whether you''re
    checking out Jesus

    You''re investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody''s got
    a next step to take

    Our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don''t have it
    all together

    Who are work in progress kind of people doing that stuff

    So, however that is, grateful that you''re here, let''s get right to it

    I want to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just
    pay attention as you watch this commercial

    Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you''re an old person

    Okay, but, I recognize it, it''s fine

    But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this
    commercial

    Check this out, okay, here we go

    Mary Clary thinks her zipper bags are the best, and will never switch to Gladlock
    zipper bags

    That''s right, never

    Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here, with either
    your bag filled with angry bees

    Or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees

    See that green color chain seal there, Mayor? That shows you the Gladlock bag
    is closed

    Your bag doesn''t have a green seal

    You know, change is good, I''ll take the Gladlock zipper bag

    Just kidding, Mayor

    When it really counts, don''t get mad, get Gladlock zipper bags

    Okay, some of you remember this commercial

    Now, what I want to, obviously it''s a goofy commercial, and I''ll help you by
    over-analyzing it and taking it way too seriously

    Okay, that''s the gift I bring

    But, let''s look at this for a moment

    This ad is a question about which bag, it''s a question about bag choice

    Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue
    seal, which makes the green thing

    Which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial

    And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag

    Would you rather have hold the angry bees that we''re going to give you

    And secondly, we''re going to put you into this phone booth, which you''ve somehow
    agreed to do this

    The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea

    That these people who are making this scenario happen, not only have they got
    bees to give a person to hold

    But also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone
    booth

    And for those of you who don''t know what a phone booth is

    It''s like an elevator that doesn''t go anywhere, that''s all that it is

    It''s the same thing, you''re talking on a phone but it''s in a tiny little space
    and nobody else joins you in there

    But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth
    to which they''re agreeing to do

    And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

    How is she not like, why don''t you just take all the bees and go away, I don''t
    want to do any of this

    I don''t care what bag you use, I''m not doing this, this whole thing is stupid

    The power dynamic, everything, like I''m going to convince her and we''re going
    to lock her in this thing

    How is she not just like, no, I''m not doing that

    The question is, and why are people saying yes to this

    And the question, over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I''m taking
    it too seriously

    The question is, well who''s in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea?

    Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking
    them and handing them to a person

    And says, then we''re going to lock you in a phone booth, the whole thing is bizarre
    and absurd

    And who''s in charge here

    Now that question, who''s in charge here, is a critical question when it comes
    to anxiety

    Who''s in charge here?

    We''re in week two of a series called The Bag of Angry Bees and it''s a series
    on anxiety

    Because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry
    bees

    But I want to catch us up a little bit, if you weren''t here last week and make
    sure we''re all in the same sort of playing fields

    As we talk about this idea of anxiety

    One of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate
    between fear and anxiety

    Fear is the response to something that has happened

    Like bear, person with a knife coming after us, oh my gosh that''s fear

    Anxiety is, what if there''s a bear, what if we go there and there''s a person
    with a knife?

    That''s anxiety, are you with me? One''s anticipating a thing, one is responding
    to a particular thing

    And we said generally what happens when we''re talking about anxiety is that the
    thing that''s happening

    Or even the thing that''s a concern is a reasonable concern

    But in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level

    Or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level, are you with me?

    Now, we also said this, it''s so important to keep in mind that all anxieties
    have something in common

    Every single anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty

    It''s about a low tolerance for things that are not certain

    And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

    All of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety

    It''s one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most
    current statistics on this

    Which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have
    someone in your house perhaps

    Or you yourself as someone who has anxiety

    And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where
    you grew up

    What kind of healthy environment you might have encountered

    Some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have
    anxiety

    The best solution is simply as people have told us or we''ve understood is simply
    snap out of it

    Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don''t, just get over it

    It''s a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff

    Compensate by being high functioning

    And just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it

    Because you shouldn''t have to deal with it, just snap out of it

    And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone
    told us

    We were told, here''s what you should do

    Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you

    And then by comparison, you won''t care anymore

    You know, there''s conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it''s pretty anxious for
    those people

    So I guess I don''t get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either
    of the anxieties

    In either case

    And if you''re a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who''s
    like

    You know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who''s a Jesus follower

    Who maybe they''re a little misguided, but you''re like, hey, I just want to let
    you know

    I''m suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression

    And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you

    Don''t be anxious about anything, thank you so much

    And they''re like, well, don''t be anxious

    But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your
    request to God

    And you''re just like, well, I don''t know what you''re supposed to do with that

    I guess I''m not supposed to have this, because the solution to having anxieties
    apparently just don''t

    And if I don''t know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away
    and deal with it as a shame thing

    Because I''m not supposed to have it, and so it never really gets dealt with at
    all

    The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level

    And here''s what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question

    Who''s in charge?

    A person who''s suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey,
    who''s in charge?

    What they would say is, and again, I''m paraphrasing, but to say it this way

    My feelings or my thoughts are in charge, I''m not in charge, not me, I''m not
    in charge

    I''m freaking out here

    And this is where it starts, this is where anxiety begins to become kind of an
    issue

    In other words, probably another way to say it is this

    Anxiety has a double effect

    There''s the anxiety that we feel, and then there''s the way we feel about our
    anxiety

    To say it this way, I''m freaking out about freaking out

    And this is why people get stuck in it

    It''s not just that I''m freaking out as if that was enough

    It''s that now I have anxiety about my anxiety

    Like, what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can''t control and all of
    it starts to spiral

    And you maybe have this experience, or do you know people who do

    And here''s what I want to do today

    I want to give us one tool

    It''s not the answer to everything, it doesn''t solve all the anxiety

    It''s just one really underutilized, very accessible tool

    That also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well

    It''s just gonna, and just again, to make sure we reiterate

    I''m not an expert

    Someone told you were doing a series on anxiety

    You might have thought you''re like, maybe you''re new and you''re like, I''m
    not sure about Jesus

    But I''ll come here that and you thought, they told you I''m an expert on this

    I''m not an expert, I''m not a therapist, this is not my degree

    I''m a fellow traveler in this

    I do a little bit of research on some stuff

    I''m looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing

    My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys

    But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today

    And it''s kind of a next step building on what we did last week

    But I also want to tell you this, fair warning

    The way we''re gonna get to this one tool is a very windy road

    Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes

    I don''t appreciate the laughter

    It''s fine, it''s fine

    But you''re gonna be like, what in the world are we doing?

    And then I promise I will bring it back home

    But you''re gonna wonder for a little bit

    Because I''m gonna start in a place you may not expect

    And then we''re gonna get there

    So I''m gonna start in ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

    Because that''s where you thought I was gonna go

    Here''s what we''re gonna do, I''m totally serious

    Ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

    Here''s what happens, it happens in six phases

    This is the first of the phases, it starts like this

    It''s the boundary making of a particular thing

    Here''s where things are, here''s where things are

    This separates the sacred space from the not sacred space

    Boundary making

    Then after things are sort of put up, there''s some filming

    There''s some filling of things and some further separation of things

    There''s either, sometimes there''s interior spaces

    Which are separated from other spaces

    All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East

    And the sixth phase of the Temple construction

    Whatever it is, whatever god that''s being worshipped there

    You typically, it''s placed within there on the sixth phase

    So there''s typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation

    Sort of the creation of a temple

    And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple

    To give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple

    Now, there are six days, there''s a seven day creation

    But there''s a six day creation narrative in the Bible

    Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation

    So god created mankind in his own image

    And the image of god, he created them male and female

    He created them, this is the sixth day of creation

    Now, let me pause right here for a second

    What''s being said by this, many scholars agree

    That the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible

    Which some of you are like, I''m not sure I''m buying into that yet

    That''s okay, don''t worry about it, just stay with me on this

    That the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god''s temple

    The entire thing, no temple could contain him

    So the whole cosmos is his temple

    And instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day

    It''s a person, people become the representation of this god

    In his temple, the whole cosmos

    But the people aren''t just a decoration, there''s more, verse 28

    God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number

    And fill the earth and subdue it some translations

    And have dominion over it

    Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky

    And over every living creature that moves on the ground

    So this, the people aren''t just simply decoration

    There''s more there, they''re blessed and they''re told to multiply and have dominion

    And the answer to the question, who''s in charge of all of the created stuff?

    The answer is, people are

    People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation

    In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to

    Is god himself, other than that, they''re supposed to be over all of these things

    It''s gift to Genesis chapter 2, where it gets a little bit more specific about
    some of this stuff

    Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground

    All the wild animals and all the birds of the sky

    And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them

    And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name

    So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild
    animals

    Notice what''s happening here, there''s something about this man

    This created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos

    Which now has this responsibility to name everything

    Again, this might be a challenge for some of you

    Like I''m not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what''s happening here

    Because here''s what''s happening in naming

    Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible

    Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this

    The first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing

    So when someone names a thing, it says this is a that and I''m not that

    That''s not me, over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is
    from me

    That''s separate from me

    Those are animals, I''m not, that''s animals, I''m me

    Does that make sense, this is differentiation, you''re different than me

    That''s what''s being said, when we name a thing

    Secondly what happens in naming is sort of an authority over

    Probably better said is it implies they''re taking responsibility for a thing

    So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I''m not that, that''s
    not me

    But it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named

    This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible

    The Old Testament, the Old Covenant

    Part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting

    Kind of conversation about names

    Not least of which is the name of God

    Which is kind of if you read Moses'' interaction with God

    In the burning bush story, perhaps you''ve heard of that story before

    But one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool

    What do I tell people your name is as if to say

    Because it''s a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed

    It''s so unbelievably important and sacred

    In fact, to this day, you will find

    Very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God

    They''ll refer to God as this word, Hashem

    Who in that word simply means the name

    Like we don''t even want to whisper, say the name of God

    Because it''s so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment

    So the word simply to describe God is just the name

    Names are crucial

    Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible

    But you know this, even nicknaming has rules

    Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up

    Maybe you still go by that nickname

    Maybe introduce yourself as a particular name

    Maybe, you know, like, but there''s some rules that go along with that

    You know that there''s rules about that

    Now the first rule of nicknaming is

    You don''t get to choose your own nickname

    You don''t get to decide

    Like I don''t get to say, you guys just want to let you know

    Now I''m going by MacGyver

    Kind of rhymes with McGuire

    Plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum

    And like a, you know, rubber band

    And he could like, oh look, let''s fly away and escape

    He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a

    Like a scuba tank, he could save the world

    You know, I''m going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now

    Woo, I''m just going, you know that doesn''t work

    That''s not how it goes, you can''t choose your nickname

    You don''t get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you

    And the way it always works is sort of a top-down method

    Either the leader, the group of a person is like

    You''re now this, or the group decides

    Hey, we''ve decided you''re going by this nickname

    You''ll get to choose it, you can''t declare it

    It''s what we''ve all decided because it''s a top-down method

    It''s the way it''s worked, it never gets to be the other way

    It''s always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of

    Ascribing a nickname to a person

    And there''s always, it tends to be, not always

    But tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery

    That''s based in truth a little bit, like it''s sort of

    A little bit funny, but it''s based in truth

    It always sort of connects, there''s a dotted line to that

    You know, so I can never figure out, even to this day

    Why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky

    I can''t figure out what the truth was

    In there, I don''t really know, that''s weird

    Anyway, so anyway, where was I going?

    Now, nicknaming, you don''t get to choose your own name

    Right, you guys watch Seinfeld and you know, maybe you saw

    George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him

    The top-down method is how this works

    Remember this, this is going to matter in a second

    And there''s always an element of sort of truth and mockery

    That kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff

    Now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man

    This man is what we would call demonized

    He''s possessed by a demon

    And what you see with this man is he''s naked, he''s living in the tombs

    He doesn''t have a house, he''s all by himself

    Now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world

    We have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

    Or, you know, demon possession

    A couple of different things

    One of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go

    Look, they don''t have sophisticated psychological analysis

    Anytime anybody had something, sort of some sort of mental illness

    They would just naturally ascribe it to demon

    That''s a lot of demon, that''s what that is

    And I just want to say, you might be right

    But I also want to just propose something else

    The Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality

    That is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular, ongoing
    basis

    And sort of are visible, or there''s an unseen world of things that are happening

    And I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic

    People who suffer from mental illness aren''t necessarily being demonized, so
    to speak

    And yet there is still in the Bible this description of things

    That where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do

    And here''s what I just want to say

    The one does not exclude the other

    There is mental illness that they don''t know how to diagnose back in the first
    century

    And there is also demonic activity that''s also at work

    So I just want to make sure we''re all clear on that

    Are we okay moving forward with this?

    Okay, good, here we go

    Now, here''s the scene, Luke 8, 26

    They sailed to the regions of the Jeresians, which is across the lake from Galilee

    This is in the northern part of Israel, there''s two big lakes

    There''s the Sea of Galilee and then there''s the Dead Sea

    The Dead Sea is way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee is much more important

    Because things live there

    And on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called
    the other side

    This is where people don''t go very often

    But when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town

    For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house

    But had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again

    This is this person who lives by himself, naked in the tombs

    And this man runs up to Jesus

    And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of
    his voice

    What''s important to keep in mind

    When you see this, and the story is also in Mark 5

    You can read this story, and one of the things that''s crucial when you see it

    Is there''s always this really difficult distinction between

    It''s hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking

    Who''s talking here? Is the demon or is it the guy?

    What I want you to see is I think that''s kind of important to kind of keep it

    It''s important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay,
    with me

    Now, when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top
    of his voice

    What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?

    I beg you, don''t torture me

    So this is such an interesting kind of encounter

    Some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

    Is an attempt to gain control over Jesus

    Which of course fails miserably because he doesn''t know rule number two

    It''s a top-down model, you can''t, Jesus is over everything, you can''t do this

    This is what''s going to be shown in a moment here

    But there''s this sort of crying out of Jesus'' name as an attempt perhaps to
    gain control over him

    Verse 29

    For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

    This is what''s sort of like an out-of-order sentence

    Like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this

    So Luke is recording what happened

    He''s like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don''t torture us
    or whatever

    Is because of this right here

    For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

    And many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept
    under guard

    He had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places

    Let''s pause here for a second

    So often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness

    So often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness

    It isn''t that the man was like, oh man I feel like I got a thing

    I got a ghost

    It''s that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone

    Then Jesus asked him

    What is your name?

    Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him

    The word legion to talk about a Roman legion is about roughly five to six thousand
    Roman soldiers

    So the idea of this means that there''s a ton of demonic activity in this particular
    person

    What is your name?

    The question that''s being asked here is who''s in charge

    Things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of
    the moment

    And Jesus doesn''t need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face
    of the whole idea here

    The demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know,
    he''s able to like name him

    What''s being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over
    the whole thing

    And takes control of the moment

    And then there''s this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next

    Is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs

    Which are nearby apparently

    And then the pigs run into a lake and drown

    That''s the story, they''re like, we''re possessed!

    And they drown, that''s it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way

    If you guys are wondering, that''s what galloping pigs look like

    And they run away and they drown

    Now, the question that you have, which is a fair question is

    What does this have to do with anybody''s anxiety?

    Let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this

    One of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a
    linking and overlapping

    Between the thing that''s afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression

    And that person themselves, they make it their identity

    It''s one of the most tragic things that happens

    One of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety journey

    This is my wife, she said

    I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety

    I''m an anxious person, I''m just anxious, I''m always anxious, I''m anxious

    She finally had to realize maybe that wasn''t the way I was supposed

    Maybe I wasn''t made, God didn''t make me anxious

    This was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed

    Fusing the two things together

    Curtis Chang in his book, which I mentioned before

    I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them

    Or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we''ll know

    No, just kidding, but if you want to borrow it, it''s fine

    But we have a couple, his book''s great, but here''s one of the things he says
    to this very effect

    When we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended
    periods

    I love the language

    We identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these
    thoughts

    The more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and
    over

    We talked about this last week, about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious
    narrative

    The more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa

    The more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads

    The more we become indistinguishable from that narrative

    Such that we cannot abandon those thoughts

    And this mental fusion can be so complete, we sometimes don''t even recognize
    that we''ve been hijacked

    In other words, when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over
    and over and over again in our heads

    And it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating

    You can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the
    affliction that is upon us

    And find a way to rein it in

    So here''s what we need to do

    Name it

    Name it

    We have to call the thing, whatever the thing is, we have to call it what it is

    So that we can separate it from ourselves

    Here''s what Curtis Chang says once again

    When we can name our thoughts, we recognize them as distinct from us

    Differentiation

    We''re meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in
    our minds

    But they''re not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation

    There''s a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought
    becoming us

    When I named my anxious thoughts, he says, I began to experience a sense of authority
    over them

    The more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them

    The more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify

    The more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement

    And the more I said, oh, I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded
    away

    So let''s call it what it is, we''ve got to name it

    Got to name it

    And the question you have, which is a fair question, is how do I name it?

    I just feel like I''m freaking out, I don''t know how to name this thing, what
    am I supposed to do with it?

    And I just want to tell you, again, we''re just going to look at kind of, this
    is the very beginning stages of stuff

    But let''s just talk about this for a moment

    One of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to
    do this, is to find where there is friction in your life

    Where are things not going smoothly? Where''s their friction?

    In other words, take it a different way

    Can you identify a pattern in your life where you''re regularly agitated, afraid,
    etc.

    Where there''s probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing?

    For instance, if you''re going through Del Taco and you''re like, they gave you
    the wrong hot sauce

    And you''re like, that''s a bummer, they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a
    del scorcho

    And they gave me regular old lame hot sauce

    And you''re like, that''s a bummer, that''s an appropriate response

    If you''re like, they didn''t give me del scorcho, I''m burning the place down

    By the way, that''s a serious offense when you don''t get del scorcho

    Okay, but I''m just saying that there''s a moment where you''re like, my response
    should be a two, but it feels like it''s a twelve

    This is probably where you''re going, maybe there''s something in here where I''m
    trying to figure out what''s going on here

    There''s a pattern where I''m overreacting, it should be a two and I''m giving
    it a twelve out of ten

    Something''s a problem here and there''s different triggering events for all of
    us

    And they''re all different kinds of scales

    For me, confession, okay

    I have to be very, very careful

    Anytime I''m in any kind of competition with my children

    Because there''s a part of me, and I''ve told you guys this before, if you''re
    with us last week, I said

    The thing that I''ve been naming recently over the course of my life is that what''s
    been chasing me is this right here

    Being a disappointment and being irrelevant, these are the things that come up
    with

    Now, in a competition, anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser

    Not just lose, but be a loser

    It''s right into this stuff

    So, I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition

    Which is really, I have to measure, and some things I can''t do

    Whether it''s like, doing things that''s like an activity we do together, like
    surfing

    It''s like, my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot

    But I''m like, you know, I just, I''m frustrated that I''m not as good as they
    are

    They''re in there, like, my oldest is twenty

    He lives, like, it goes to school right next to the beach

    He surfs constantly, he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes

    I''m like, what is wrong with the world?

    Anyway, but he does that, he''s awesome

    And my other kids are incredible, all the things they do

    And I''m like, I''m out, and it''s like, I''m making it a competition and I have
    to win

    We''re playing cards, we''re playing horse, and how much does it matter if I''m
    like

    Playing horse with my son, how important is it that I win?

    Crucial is the answer to that question

    But it should be a two, and it''s a twelve, why does it matter?

    I have to be very careful with these things

    Where''s their friction, name it, you have to find some of the friction

    It''s probably one of the most helpful things you can do

    But there''s another layer to this, and this is where it gets even a little bit
    more difficult

    And it''s nonetheless crucial, and by the way, I have to apologize in advance

    Before I give you this, I''m going to show you it in a second

    It rhymes, okay?

    And I always am afraid when it rhymes, like, oh gosh

    We just packaged this up in a little neat little thing

    And there''s probably a little tiny little, if you look closely

    A little TM on the top right of the circle around it, like trademark

    There''s nothing, I just want to make sure, I want you to make sure you remember
    it

    But for those of you guys that have a high, like really sensitive cheese meter

    This is going to set you off, okay?

    It''s very cheesy, but it''s really crucial, okay?

    So bear with me, okay? You guys ready for that?

    I think you can handle this, okay?

    So not only are we finding the friction, where is there this ongoing sort of pattern

    Where I''m overreacting to certain things

    But bear with me, probably what is more crucial than that

    Is to find the fiction behind the friction

    I do not appreciate that, sir

    Because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie

    Behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie

    Like, wow, that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular
    thing

    And the thing that people, it may not be you, but people that are around you

    That might suffer from anxiety, they''re believing a particular lie

    That''s being rehearsed over and over again in their head

    And it''s nearly perfect, and the question we have to ask

    Which is a very courageous question, which may require actual therapy

    You might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff

    But the point is, there is 99%

    I''m going to go 100%, okay?

    There''s a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety

    There is a perfect lie behind it

    And to ask the question, where is the lie that''s fueling this kind of anxiety
    is crucial

    Behind the anxiety is a particular lie

    I''ve showed you kind of my own thing that''s chasing me down, and it''s a lie

    Let me give you some things to think about

    If you''re having trouble kind of identifying it, this is not going to answer
    every question

    But maybe some of these you might connect with, okay?

    Here

    If blank happens, it means I''ve lost control

    And when I lose control, the whole world goes at just whatever

    I have to be in control

    And if something happens, it means I''ve lost control

    It could be any number of things for you, it can be small, and it can be big

    It can be I''m late for dropping my kids off for school, I''m late for picking
    my...

    It could be I''m late for school, it could be if I screw up a homework assignment
    that I''m supposed to turn in

    It could be if I don''t connect with these people, if I mess up my own

    If I don''t get on Instagram enough times, or I don''t see these things, it means
    I''ve lost control

    Some of you might have this scenario, there won''t be enough

    I know what will happen, there''s just not going to be enough blank

    Filling whatever you want there

    Money, attention, affection, love

    I know that if I say yes to this now, then there won''t be enough later

    Or if this person says yes to this in my life

    There''s only a certain, there''s like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that
    I need

    And if they take a slice, it''s going to be one less thing available for me, or
    for anybody else

    Or just won''t be enough of whatever it is

    You can, maybe that''s you

    Some of you have this, if I can''t blank well, whatever it is

    I''ll be alone

    If I can''t do well as a student, if I don''t perform well at my job

    If I''m not a good friend, if I don''t appear wonderful, if I don''t do beauty
    well

    If I don''t do personal health and fitness well

    If I don''t do living the California life well, then I''ll be all alone and people
    won''t want me

    That may be you

    Some people have this one, it just connects with a lot of people

    Things are going so great, but now what?

    Like I know everything''s awesome, but that only means there''s an impending doom
    right around the corner

    I feel like things are going great, my friendships are great

    Maybe you''re single and you''ve got all your crew of friends, you''re like, we''re
    getting along great

    And we have this community of people that we get to be around and it''s so amazing

    It''s all going to go, something''s going to happen immediately

    Maybe you''re a person who''s got a mom group and you''re all hanging out

    Things are incredible, you''ve got your kids and your marriages are incredible

    And you''re like, it''s a matter of time before everything goes away

    There''s going to be disease, there''s going to be a volcano, there''s going to
    be something that swallows us up

    We''re all going to die, I just know it

    There''ll be a puddle on the way to church, I mean, you never know

    A lot of people have this, things are going great, but they can''t forever

    Just waiting for the house of cards to fall

    That''s an anxiety

    Some people have this, that there''s a sense that I''ll never be understood no
    matter what I do

    However, I try to communicate who I am, I''ll never be fully understood

    Which is a matter of being not loved and being alone

    Once again, I just cannot be an understood person

    And this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state

    Some people have this

    What if I or we never get through blank?

    We''re a tough patch in our marriage

    I''m in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life

    I want to meet Mr. Wright, I want to meet Mrs. Wright

    I want to be around these people

    But I''m in this tough spot of loneliness and I can''t get through it

    What if we never get through it?

    What if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness, I never get
    through it?

    What if that never happens?

    I''m just preparing myself to never get through because I don''t see the light
    at the end of the tunnel

    So what if I never get through it?

    All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we''re
    worried about

    And they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff

    And for some of you, it may not be you

    Like I said, you may not be the person who''s got anxiety

    You may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff

    But you probably live with people and you''re like, why are they reacting like
    a 12 when it should be a 2?

    Because there''s probably a fiction behind it that''s generating that sort of
    thing

    Now, what do we do with that?

    Now, this is really important

    What we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you
    perceive Jesus

    Some of you are like, look, I''m okay with Jesus that came because you''re talking
    about anxiety and some cool stuff

    But I just want to tell you, there''s a dimension that we''re going to talk about
    here

    Which is so important to understanding what it is to walk with Jesus

    Because there''s a spiritual dimension to faith

    It is not just practical help for all these kinds of things

    You go to lots of places to get that

    And we''re okay with that, by the way

    We''re a church, we''re kind of okay with Jesus

    But I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next

    That''s going to push this a little further

    And I think it''s probably, for some of you, maybe like an invitation to step
    into something you''ve not yet considered

    But here''s what I want to do

    Remember, when you look back at the story of Jesus with this demonized person

    This man who''s naked in the tombs

    It''s Jesus who extracts the name of the demon

    Jesus doesn''t need the name to be able to take control, which is really important
    to keep in mind

    But Jesus extracts the name of the demon, the demon says his own name, Legion

    The guy doesn''t do it

    The demon''s the one who drove him into isolation

    He''s the demon, he''s the naked demon guy living in the tombs

    Doesn''t live at home anymore

    And even the guy couldn''t name the thing

    Jesus has to draw it out of this person

    And maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff

    You actually need some supernatural assistance to do it

    You actually need this

    This is what Jesus really can do

    And the inner stuff, all this stuff, it''s hard

    It requires courage and humility

    And this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

    Let''s go back to Philippians 4, 6 and 7

    Do not be anxious about anything

    But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving

    Present your request to God

    And the peace of God which transcends all understanding

    Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus

    What''s so crucial to keep in mind is

    Every anxious person loves the second part of that

    The peace of God which transcends understanding

    We all want that

    Even if you''re not an anxious person, you''re like, that sounds great

    The peace of God which is beyond even my own understanding

    I want that

    But what I want to do today is this

    During everything in mind

    I want to focus on this part of that verse

    Prayer and petition

    When most of us think about prayer

    We think about petition

    Which is asking for a particular thing

    Petition means I''m asking for a particular thing

    The language of petition is in the First Amendment

    The right to petition the government is part of what''s in there

    Like that actually gets to ask for a particular thing

    To make something, to make a request, a formal request of a thing

    Which is part of what''s being described here

    In fact, even it says, make your request known to God

    But there''s also something else there

    It says prayer and petition

    Which they''re under the same umbrella

    But there''s something different about the two things

    Which is worth thinking about

    Because for a lot of us, all we think about is prayer

    Is while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers

    And I''m ready for a couple different answers

    You know, like maybe you heard that growing up

    It''s like, yes, you can have what you want, no you can''t

    Or you just have to wait around a little while

    It''s like, that''s all we know about prayer

    I don''t want to say that there''s a beautiful part to that

    But I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that

    Because maybe in prayer what we get to do

    Is to seek God to do something that''s beyond asking him for stuff

    Or to just simply solve a thing

    One of the things we get to do in prayer

    Is actually to ask God to reveal something to us, about us

    Which means we''re not asking, we''re just listening in effect

    Here''s what the Psalmist writes in Psalm 139

    These famous words, search me God and know my heart

    Test me and know my anxious thoughts

    See if there is any offensive

    Some translations have the word hurtful way in me

    And lead me in the way everlasting

    Like there is some way through the anxiety

    To be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life

    Not just forever, like someday far away

    But right now in the present

    To say it differently, again, another rhyming thing

    Please buckle your seatbelt, I apologize

    Please read this, okay, stay with me

    All healing, whether it''s like a medical

    Like you broke your foot, you got an ear infection

    You got a heart condition, all healing begins with revealing

    We have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we''re facing

    So that it can be addressed

    This is part of the naming process, right

    And it''s scary because we have to see it for what it is

    So here''s what I''m going to do, I''m going to give you a prayer

    It is a two-word prayer, you can practice it whenever you want

    However you want, I''m going to give you a rundown

    On how to do it right now in a second

    But it''s a two-word prayer that requires some courage

    And it''s different for a lot of you than maybe you haven''t yet understood what
    prayer is

    And here''s what it looks like, you ready?

    Search me

    Search me

    There''s something that needs to be revealed to me

    That I can''t find on my own to be named

    So that I can differentiate it from myself

    And I need God to reveal it in me

    With tenderness, with care, not with shame

    Not with condemnation, but with love

    That gets drawn out

    So, that in mind

    Let''s pray

    I''m going to give you a moment, just as your eyes are closed

    To sit in the stillness of this

    If there is a contrast between the loudness

    And the voices of anxiety, it must be stillness

    And silence

    Jesus

    Search me

    Search me

    Jesus that I might find where there''s friction

    Search me, Jesus, that I might find where there''s friction.

    Search me, Jesus, to uncover the lie, the fiction that''s undergirding that friction.

    When I can''t name them, will you name them, my anxious thoughts, Jesus?

    Will you lead me in the way everlasting?

    Father, would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you
    in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives?

    Would you hear your name?

    The name that rescues, that breaks through into the darkness, Jesus.

    Jesus.

    It is in your name that we pray, Jesus.

    Amen.

    Let it break, and your name still, call the seed of still, the rage and need of
    still, every way.

    And your name, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    We call these bones to live, and call these lungs to sing once again.

    I will praise Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Would you do this? Would you just stand together?

    One of the things that, you probably heard me say this before, if you''ve been
    around, which is when we''re singing, we''re setting our collective prayer to
    music.

    That''s all we''re doing.

    And there''s some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same
    time, in the same place.

    There''s something that happens in that, and I don''t know how to explain it,
    I just know that it does.

    And so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices,
    to sing that one more time together, and then I''ll close out our time.

    So would you lead us in that?

    We sing Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing?

    Where there is darkness that needs to tremble, you can call in the name of Jesus.

    Might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety
    and depression and loneliness and isolation?

    May you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God, search me and know
    my anxious thoughts.

    See if there''s a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting.

    Whatever you''re up against, may you know, may it be conferred upon you the love
    of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy
    Spirit in Jesus'' name.

    So good to be with you. Amen.

    So great to be together. We''ll see you guys later.

    and i know if those of you guys are like parents of young kids you're like nothing\
    \ really magical\nhappened they still woke up and it was just four in the morning\
    \ as opposed to five and that's real\nwonderful for us uh in any event i'm glad\
    \ that you guys made it my name is jeff i'm one of the\npastors here grateful\
    \ to have you guys with us if you're new with us a lot of new people today a lot\n\
    of people um by the way the church has a kind of if you're new we kind of the\
    \ the sort of i don't\nknow culture here is that we kind of are we don't believe\
    \ jesus is a secret we're supposed to keep\nthat if people want to know about\
    \ him we invite people to come check it out make their own\ndecision for jesus\
    \ you know kind of on their own opinion we don't you know so anyway it's not a\n\
    secret club where we have like special handshakes and little little passwords\
    \ or whatever it's just\nlike you want to come in and make a decision about jesus\n\
    that's always our hope is that people get an invitation to do that and so if you're\
    \ wondering\nkind of who we are this group of people does not have all the answers\
    \ we are not the ones who have\nfigured it out we're people who are journeying\
    \ towards jesus we believe that's what we were\nconvinced that's what we were\
    \ made for is life with jesus but we also know that life kind of\npursuit in pursuit\
    \ of jesus doesn't always go in a straight line and we trip over ourselves and\
    \ we\nkind of you know we hurt ourselves and hurt other people and we kind of\
    \ need each other to pick each\nother up and kind of redirect ourselves toward\
    \ jesus again and so if you're looking for a place\nwhere everybody's kind of\
    \ got all the answers and figured it out i just want to let you know\nprepare\
    \ to be disappointed by us we are not those people but we do believe that we are\

    \ painful ways just basically practical stuff\nwhat are some lies that we're generally\
    \ okay telling each other like they're kind of like\nwe kind of have to tell them\
    \ a little bit they kind of go on and on lies we're kind of okay\ntelling people\
    \ we're kind of around a lot not the big serious ones but like little ones we\
    \ kind of\nwe're a little bit fibby so to speak anybody know i'm talking about\
    \ give an example\nno that doesn't those genes they don't make you look fat\n\
    i remember and i told this story and i you know i before some of you have heard\
    \ this story and you\nknow i remember i remember one time i was like this is a\
    \ couple years ago i told my wife i go\noh my gosh i mean you still got it the\
    \ tight jeans look great on you\nthese are my fat jeans\ni mean i was i was like\
    \ oh my gosh i'm trying to do that she's like they're supposed to be\nloose you\
    \ know thanks a lot i'm burning these i was like oh god i'm trying to do that\
    \ she's like\ngosh i'm the i can't win you know all right what else other other\
    \ sort of lies were most people are\nokay kind of telling every so often what\
    \ else that was the only one that was the one lie everything\nelse we're not okay\
    \ with anything else i'm fine yeah i'm fine it's a big one i'm fine i'm not\n\
    panicking you're panicking i'm always panicking you're anxious i'm not anxious\
    \ you're i'm fine\ni'm totally fine we're all fine here we're fine i'm fine right\
    \ good what else i'm busy\ncan't get there i'm busy i gotta get to this level\
    \ real quick and then we'll make sure we're\nwhat else\nwait wait start what's\
    \ yours i don't have a problem you do okay\nyeah yeah that's that's something\
    \ i've i've never really tried in\nmy marriage i'm a little afraid of doing that\
    \ uh what about you someone else said something\ni know where i'm going i'm not\
    \ lost what does apple maps know anyways they don't know i know\nwhere i'm going\
    \ and you don't know where i'm going i don't know where i'm going i don't know\
    \ where i'm\ngoing right yeah there's that stuff there's also this one some of\
    \ you have maybe tried this before\nyou're running a little bit late i'm on my\
    \ way and a little bit wait mean a little bit late means i\nhaven't even left\
    \ yet a little bit late means i forgot about the meeting i'm on my way means i'm\n\
    just about to get into the shower and get showered up and get ready to go there\
    \ some of you have\ntried this one before which of course you know you've been\
    \ pulled over and the officer says do\nyou know why i pulled you over i have no\
    \ idea why you pulled me over i thought 85 was perfectly\ncool zone obviously\
    \ how about this one no i do not watch the bachelor\nwhat a horrible person would\
    \ ever watch that show of course there's that too but it makes you wonder\nat\
    \ least to a certain extent how do you know when someone's being honest with you\
    \ and and how do\nthey know when you're being honest with them and probably more\
    \ importantly how do you know when\nyou're being honest with you because every\
    \ single one of us has had at some point we've had some\nmoment we've like am\
    \ i kidding myself with this is this sort of is this really actually happening\n\
    we've all had that too\nwell let's start at least this series by defining a couple\
    \ of terms let's start with the idea of\ntruth now the idea of what is truth is\
    \ like the biggest philosophical question that goes back\neons people have tried\
    \ to solve this problem this is not my moment in the sun to give you\nthe like\
    \ definition of what that is i just needed a practical handle for what we're talking\
    \ about\nduring the next couple of weeks but here is the super deep definition\
    \ of what truth is ready here\nit is truth is what actually is all it is it's\
    \ just saying it's just reality truth is reality\ntruth is what actually is and\
    \ when it comes to honesty it's not just reality it's not just\nwe're talking\
    \ about honesty honest honesty is simply the accurate representation of what is\n\
    it's the retelling of reality and the closer to reality that we are the more honest\
    \ that we're\nbeing again if truth is just what actually is it's reality and honesty\
    \ is the retelling of the\naccurate representation of that reality then that's\
    \ all that we're doing honesty is then sort\nof this closer to reality the more\
    \ honest we're being we all value honesty we have high esteem\nfor it i mean right\
    \ now even in the sort of the i don't know if you knew there's like an election\n\
    coming up a lot of people don't know that but it's the truth it's the truth it's\
    \ the truth it's the\ntruth i don't know that there's a big election coming up\
    \ i don't know if you heard that but like\nwe talk about and even the rival candidates\
    \ always accuse the other of lying and honesty is such\nincredibly important value\
    \ and but the truth is that every single one of us lies a little all the\ntime\
    \ as we just talked about doctors know this when you come into the doctor's office\
    \ and you\nhave to fill out the form that says how often how many drinks do you\
    \ have per week you're always\nlike what should i really tell they always double\
    \ it i just want you to know whatever you're writing\nthey double it you're like\
    \ oh once a year i went to another church where they have like wine in\nlike one\
    \ time i did that and they're like you know that kind of thing you have that sort\
    \ of\nscenario they also do the opposite too and you know they ask you how many\
    \ times a week do you\nexercise by the way they've just taken your blood pressure\
    \ they know your heart rate you're like i\nwent six times a week i'm training\
    \ for a triathlon they're like you're resting heart rates a hundred\nand five\
    \ either you're really nervous or you're lying and so they just cut that in half\
    \ they just\nknow what to do with that but we all lie to a certain extent we lie\
    \ for a couple different\nreasons we lie to hide our weaknesses and we lie to\
    \ gain an advantage and sometimes we lie to avoid\npain i mean all of us do it\
    \ at some point at least to a certain we allow ourselves that room to do it\n\
    and we also lie probably at least as we're talking about in this particular context\
    \ for this series\nand i get someone called me up there's other reasons why we\
    \ lie last service i know i get\nthere's i just just for the general sense and\
    \ the bell curve of the reasons and our all of our sort\nof ways of living this\
    \ is kind of where we lie we lie to hide weaknesses and gain advantage and\navoid\
    \ discomfort and pain but we also lie to preserve relationships this is what goes\
    \ into\nrelationships we really are in betweenmern and rey kane and the near \u041D\
    \u0430\u0434AL we lie to that\nthis is because of our spirit so and a lot of of\
    \ this is we're dying long enough just to lose\neverything but when it's we're\
    \ dying young we're dying faster we're dying faster we're dying in\ntime like\
    \ ksc how about you guys are theatori how you think life is to you know possibly\
    \ a few\nyears autonomous or something something outside of the boundaries of\
    \ the world is it just to live\naccording to your way to life right like it's\
    \ all about how well you live it's not the level of the\nworldwide value we didn't\
    \ think about these people in a more realistic sort of a sense of the scale so\n\
    else know this then all the stuff that i have outside of me to protect me and\
    \ insulate me from\nthem ever knowing it all of a sudden now they know and i'm\
    \ unprotected and what if they don't want me\nor what if they harm me or what\
    \ if i'm unlovable and if i tell them i can see what's going on in\nyou or i've\
    \ actually there's something in you that i know or about then what happens to\
    \ them\ndoes that compromise a relationship because they're unprotected and all\
    \ of a sudden\nthere's two vulnerable people who are insecure about being involved\
    \ being vulnerable and all\nof a sudden it starts to unwind the relationship starts\
    \ to unwind and so we don't tell the truth\nalso in the spirit of being honest\
    \ which let's be clear the spirit of being honest\nwe've had some pretty uncaring\
    \ people who have told us the truth in the spirit of truth telling\nhey i just\
    \ want to tell you the truth and it felt more so like it was a self-righteous\
    \ sort\nof bludgeoning by a blunt object than by actual kind of an actual honesty\
    \ it felt like\nself-righteousness like i need to tell you this and their intent\
    \ was actually it seemed like to\nharm so we've all been in those situations and\
    \ so what happens in the most bizarre way\nin the most in the strangest way in\
    \ a bizarre way because we're trying to preserve relationships\nmore often than\
    \ not lying actually becomes an indicator of how you know i'm kind of a good\n\
    person because i wouldn't want to harm you i don't want to harm i don't want we\
    \ don't need to do this\nso lying becomes a way to actually prove to you that\
    \ you know i'm a good person so like most\nthings and we talk about this i go\
    \ to this most things that we talk about this like most vices\nmost vices tend\
    \ to have a short-term payoff and a long-term pain so we're dishonest dishonesty\n\
    like it's short-term payoff long-term pain i don't want to deal with what things\
    \ look like\nright now there might be some pain i don't want to deal with what\
    \ things look like right now there\nmight be some pain um so like this thing called\
    \ and stolen ego there might be a long-term pain um but just\nyeah another Weight\
    \ Loss \u0218i's review in Northnor transcription link in the description below\
    \ if you ate more than a\nRight now, there might be some pain in the distance,\n\
    but right now, I just can't deal with it right now,\nso we kind of don't tell\
    \ the truth.\nWhere honesty, like all virtues then,\nhas a long-term payoff and\
    \ a short-term pain.\nIt may hurt right now, but in the long run,\nthis seems\
    \ to be where we want to go.\nNow, here's a mature person on the subject in the\
    \ Bible.\nThis is Psalm 141.\nJust notice this.\nNotice the maturity of this person.\n\
    I wish I was them.\nLet a righteous man strike me.\nThat's a kindness.\nLet him\
    \ rebuke me.\nThat is to say a kind of correction.\nThat's oil on my head.\nThe\
    \ term oil on my head is a description of being blessed.\nLet a righteous man\
    \ strike me.\nThat's a kindness.\nLet him rebuke me.\nThat's oil on my head, a\
    \ blessing.\nAnd to that, I say, no, thank you.\nI don't want that.\nI'm not that\
    \ courageous.\nI just go ahead and keep on keeping things a little more\non the\
    \ flattery side of things.\nThat's way better.\nSome of you have felt like, I\
    \ think Jeff would want this.\nI'm going to email him and let him know\nwhat I\
    \ really think about things.\nAnd I just want to let you know, I'm not this mature.\n\
    So if you have things that you want to share with me\nthat you think I would enjoy\
    \ them,\nsave them.\nBut anyways.\nBut we have a complicated relationship with\
    \ honesty.\nWe really do.\nI mean, over the next few weeks,\nwe're going to talk\
    \ about the truth about honesty.\nBut we know this to be true.\nHard truths are\
    \ always hard.\nThere's never a time where a hard truth is like,\nthat was wonderful\
    \ and sweet and kind and beautiful.\nAnd it was like, it always feels a little\
    \ bit tough,\nespecially in relationships.\nBecause it's hard to tell people the\
    \ hard truth\nabout themselves or about us.\nAnd we resort to lying because of\
    \ a simple economic\nsort of cost-benefit analysis.\nAnd the economics of lying\
    \ goes like this.\nWhat do I stand to gain\nby not telling the truth?\nWhat's\
    \ the probability that I'm going to get caught?\nAnd then what's the punishment\
    \ if I do get caught?\nAnd if at some level we can kind of make peace\nwith what\
    \ I stand to gain versus what I might lose\nversus the chances I'm actually going\
    \ to get caught,\nif we can make peace with those things,\nthen we'll kind of\
    \ go, it's all right.\nI give myself permission to kind of fudge it a little bit.\n\
    We do it all the time.\nAnd the fudgy sort of balance, so to speak,\ngoes like\
    \ this.\nIf I can live with myself,\nif I can look myself in the mirror and go,\n\
    this is probably okay.\nI'm still kind of at least reasonably a good person.\n\
    You know, whatever that is,\nwhatever that means.\nIf I can live with myself and\
    \ the harm is not obvious,\nthen maybe I'm okay just sort of not necessarily\n\
    telling someone or dealing with the hard truth.\nI learned a word this week.\n\
    I was listening to a podcast.\nActually, that's why I got the name for this series\n\
    called The Truth About Honesty.\nAnd in it, they describe a word that I'm like,\n\
    oh my gosh, I'm an expert in this.\nAnd this is what, for those of you who are\
    \ like,\nlisten, I'm not a liar.\nI don't tell lies.\nBut maybe what you do, which\
    \ again, this is me,\nand I'm not saying this is you for sure,\nbut I just, there's\
    \ a term describing the idea\nof not telling a lie,\nbut also sort of dodging\
    \ a little bit.\nIt's called paltering.\nPaltering.\nIt is the use of partial\
    \ truths\nto avoid confrontation or discomfort.\nIn other words, it's like saying,\n\
    look, I'm not directly lying to you.\nLike everything I've said is actually technically\n\
    falls into the category of not untrue.\nYou know what I'm saying?\nBut it's also\
    \ not exactly telling the truth either.\nSo we can always, if you're a person\
    \ like this,\nwhich is me, if you're a person like this,\nit's like, yeah, yeah,\
    \ I navigated around\nthe moral sort of hazard here of trying to figure out\n\
    when did I cross a line at actually doing a thing,\nbut yes, I was able to deceive\n\
    without ever actually telling an untruth.\nSuccess.\nPaltering.\nWho wants to,\
    \ no, just kidding.\nNo, but this is how all of us sort of do this.\nAll of us\
    \ sort of have a little bit of this in our lives,\nat least because we don't want\
    \ to be a person who's lying,\nbut we also don't want to harm anybody\nwith this\
    \ really hard, the cold, hard truth.\nUniversity of Chicago did a study on this.\n\
    University School of Business, actually,\nChicago School of Business did a study\
    \ on this.\nHere's what they found.\nPeople significantly overestimate\nthe cost\
    \ of honest conversations.\nNotice the economic,\nlanguage.\nPeople significantly\
    \ overestimate\nthe cost of honesty,\nis what's being said here.\nWe imagine this\
    \ is going to be painful.\nIf I say this, it's gonna,\nthere's no way this doesn't,\n\
    it's like this is going to hurt no matter what I do.\nTurns out we overestimate\
    \ it.\nWe're often reluctant to have\ncompletely honest conversations with others,\n\
    says Professor Emma Levine.\nWe think offering critical feedback\nor opening up\
    \ about our secrets\nwill be uncomfortable for both us\nand the people with whom\
    \ we are talking.\nThe researchers conclude\nthat such fears,\nare often misguided.\n\
    So they do all this research and they go,\nwe're way overestimating how hard it's\
    \ gonna be\nto have an honest conversation.\nIn one field experiment,\nparticipants\
    \ were instructed to be completely honest\nwith everyone in their lives for three\
    \ days.\nNow let me just stop right here for a second.\nSome of us heard, oh my\
    \ gosh, three days,\nI have to be honest for three days?\nI can't possibly do\
    \ that.\nAnd the rest of us heard,\nit's only three days?\nLike that's all, that's\
    \ the bar.\nThat's what I have to do,\nis to try to be honest for three days.\n\
    The point is, and I don't know the whole,\nall the research.\nThe point is,\n\
    I'm not gonna share the summary of the research.\nThe point is that three days\
    \ was enough to prove the point.\nYou and I, the story is like, listen,\nwhatever\
    \ happens, be completely honest for three days\nand see what happens.\nSome of\
    \ us are terrified by that idea.\nSome of us are like, give me more days.\nBut\
    \ in either event, here's what happens.\nThey're instructed to be honest,\ncompletely\
    \ honest for three days.\nIndividuals expected honesty to be less pleasant\nand\
    \ less socially connecting than it actually is.\nAnd taken together, these findings\
    \ suggest\nthat individual's avoidance of honesty\nmay be a mistake, the researchers,\
    \ right?\nBy avoiding honesty,\nindividuals miss out on opportunities\nthat they\
    \ appreciate in the long run\nand that they would want to repeat.\nSo they have\
    \ these people being honest with each other\nfor three days and what they discover\
    \ is,\nthis is way better than we thought.\nIt's actually way more helpful\nand\
    \ it's less painful than we ever imagined,\nmeaning the cost of being honest\n\
    is much lower than we thought.\nNot surprisingly, the Bible will actually reiterate\n\
    this point.\nHere's Proverbs 28, verse 23.\nWhoever rebukes, that is to say,\n\
    an honest critique, correction of a person,\nwill in the end gain favor rather\
    \ than one who has\na flattering tongue.\nOne who is a person willing to tell\
    \ another person\nthe truth will in the end gain favor,\nwhich is what we all\
    \ want,\nrather than one who has a flattering tongue.\nBecause we tell ourselves,\
    \ look, I don't wanna hurt anybody.\nI'm not trying to hurt anybody else.\nI don't\
    \ wanna cause them pain or discomfort,\nbut what it turns out to be is that the\
    \ truth is this.\nThis is mostly about us and not about them.\nWe don't wanna\
    \ hurt them, but this is really about us.\nIt's not about them.\nIt's really about\
    \ us protecting us.\nAnd what we find out over time is that the short-term\nbenefits\
    \ of avoiding the truth always come at the expense\nof the relationships we are\
    \ trying to preserve.\nIn the long run, when we are trying to preserve\na relationship\
    \ by avoiding the truth,\nit's always that relationship that suffers in the long\
    \ run.\nThe short-term benefits of avoiding the truth\nalways come at the expense\
    \ of the relationships\nwe are trying to preserve.\nNow, Jesus will talk about\
    \ a subject.\nAnd this is really important.\nHe talks about a subject that feels\
    \ only sort of loosely related to the topic.\nAnd I wanna show you it.\nBut it's\
    \ important to kind of capture it.\nBecause when we get it, it's actually crucial\
    \ for understanding\nthe whole truth about honesty kind of conversation that we're\
    \ in.\nSo here's what he says.\nMatthew 5, 33.\nWhich is, by the way, as I go\
    \ to Matthew chapter 5, before I do that.\nMatthew 5 is in the, it's Matthew 5\
    \ through 7 is a collection of sermons,\nyou know, by Jesus called the Sermon\
    \ on the Mount.\nAnd the very beginning of it, he just, this is like the beginning\
    \ of, it's Matthew 5, 6, and 7.\nAnd the very beginning of it, he just, this is\
    \ like the beginning of, it's Matthew 5, 6, and 7.\nAnd the very beginning of\
    \ it, he just, this is like the beginning of, it's Matthew 5, 6, and 7.\nYou can\
    \ read it.\nIn fact, it's really helpful.\nIt's actually, you're trying to get\
    \ your mind right around even an election standpoint.\nLike, how am I gonna, what's\
    \ the kingdom of God kind of look like the way Jesus talks about it?\nIt's these\
    \ chapters.\nSo when you're looking at it, you know, just go ahead and read it,\
    \ look at it, whatever.\nThe beginning of it is where he talks about this particular\
    \ thing.\nMatthew chapter 5.\nHere it is in the Sermon on the Mount, verse 33.\n\
    Again, you've heard it said to the people long ago,\ndon't break your oath, but\
    \ fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.\nNow, it's a typical Jesus sort\
    \ of speaking device.\nWhat he'll do is like, he'll go, you've heard it said this\
    \ way.\nAnd sometimes what he'll talk about is he'll talk about what's, you know,\n\
    oral tradition of people who have kind of passed down for generations.\nIn some\
    \ cases, he'll talk about the actual Hebrew scriptures, the Bible,\nwe call the\
    \ Old Testament.\nAnd here he's like, look, you've heard it said long ago,\ndon't\
    \ break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.\nIn the Hebrew\
    \ scriptures, a couple different times, you have this idea.\nPeople are making\
    \ vows.\nThat is to say, they're gonna go like, look, I promise I'm gonna do a\
    \ thing.\nI swear it on the Lord's name, I'm gonna make this happen.\nAnd the\
    \ emphasis in the Hebrew scripture\nis let's just make sure you do it.\nIf you're\
    \ gonna say that, stick to it.\nThat's the point.\nSo here's what he's saying.\n\
    Look, you've heard, but fulfill, you know, don't break your oath, but\nfulfill\
    \ to the Lord the vows you have made.\nBut I tell you, don't swear an oath at\
    \ all.\nSo he's like, you don't even need that.\nAnd then he goes on, either by\
    \ heaven, for it's God's throne, or by the earth,\nfor it's his footstool, or\
    \ by Jerusalem, for it's the city of the great king.\nAnd do not swear by your\
    \ head, for you can't even make one hair white or black.\nNow, notice this.\n\
    Well, you have this sort of diminishing levels of greatness of things that are\n\
    being described here, right?\nHeaven, earth, city, your own head.\nYou with me?\n\
    Like, it's sort of diminishing.\nAnd the idea that scholars will tell us is what's\
    \ happening is that people in this\nconversation are actually, what's happening\
    \ in the, in sort of typical sort\nof, you know, activity and relationships.\n\
    People are actually trying to swear an oath by things that are less than God.\n\
    Because what they're actually doing as they swear by things that are diminishing\n\
    by comparison to God, they're actually giving themselves a reason to also\ndiminish\
    \ the consequences if they don't stick to it.\nWhich means people are looking\
    \ for\na way to swear.\nSwear by things and give themselves a loophole to get\
    \ out of it.\nAnd this is what Jesus is kind of addressing here.\nSo he goes through\
    \ all, you can, not God, but heaven.\nNot heaven, but the earth.\nNot earth, but\
    \ the city.\nNot, not the city, but my own head.\nHe's like, this is all kind\
    \ of trying to find a way to give yourself a loophole to get out\nof actually\
    \ keeping your oath.\nAnd so sit, instead he says, verse 37, all you need to say\
    \ is simply yes or no.\nOr in some translations, let your yes be yes and your\
    \ no be no.\nAnything beyond this comes from the evil one.\nAnything beyond this\
    \ comes from the evil one.\nNow, what this is saying is this, to kind of summarize\
    \ the idea here.\nJesus is saying, by taking an oath, by saying, look, I swear\
    \ I'm telling you the truth or\nI'm going to do a thing.\nWhat you're essentially\
    \ saying is, ordinarily, I'm an untrustworthy liar.\nBut now because I've said\
    \ this oath, you can trust what I'm saying.\nUsually I lie, but now I swear you\
    \ can trust me.\nI'm typically a liar, but now you can trust me.\nHe's like, there's\
    \ a problem with this idea of thinking.\nUsually I lie, but now you can trust\
    \ me because I just swore on heaven or by my own head or\nby the Lord's name or\
    \ whatever.\nHe's like, maybe there's another way to do this.\nIn other words,\
    \ when we talk about this, Jesus is simply saying, be the kind of person, be\n\
    the kind of person who is so well acquainted with truth and honesty that oath\
    \ making is\nnot necessary at all.\nBy a track record over the course of your\
    \ life, be the kind of person who does what\nthey say they're going to do.\nWho\
    \ doesn't do what they say they're not going to do.\nWho doesn't do what they\
    \ say they're not going to do.\nWho doesn't do what they say they're not going\
    \ to do.\nHave a kind of integrity in the way that you are as the kind of person\
    \ that you are that\nyou don't have to like double underline it.\nLike I swear,\
    \ I'm actually going to do a thing.\nBe the kind of person who's so well acquainted\
    \ with truth and honesty that oath making is\nno longer necessary.\nNow you see\
    \ how this ties together, be the kind of person that this is for truth and\nhonesty\
    \ is kind of the way you operate.\nNow as we kind of talk about this, there's\
    \ a lot of dimensions to this conversation and\nthere's a lot of ways this could\
    \ go and I get, there's all, people are going to come\nup with exceptions to the\
    \ rule and I just would say in most cases the exception proves\nthe rule.\nBut\
    \ we know that in polite society a sort of fudge factor is kind of the norm of\
    \ how\nwe operate, especially if you're from California.\nOther parts of the country,\
    \ other parts of the world, they don't do this the same way\nwe do.\nBut Southern\
    \ California, oops, Southern California folks do this all the time.\nWe kind of\
    \ have a little bit of a like, we have to be soft and gentle with each other.\n\
    And so at some point though, we need to tell people we love what they need to\
    \ hear about\nus.\nAnd we need to know, we need, the people we love, they need\
    \ to hear what's true about\nthem as well.\nAnd that thing that's between us,\
    \ that obstacle to the relationship, whatever it might be,\naddressing it is hard.\n\
    It's hard.\nIt's hard for us and it's hard for them.\nIf we got to tell them something\
    \ that's difficult about us, we're worried about it and it's\nhard for us to do\
    \ it.\nAnd if we have to tell them something that's hard to confront them about,\
    \ a truth about\nthem, their discomfort is awful.\nAnd so we kind of let it go.\n\
    But refusing to address it ensures that it stays.\nAnd here's what I do.\nWhen\
    \ I'm encountering this situation, I'm a person, and now granted, some people\
    \ I'm\ngreat at having a confrontational truth conversation, hard truth conversation\
    \ with, and with other\npeople not so much at all.\nBut in the moments with the\
    \ people I care most about, more often than not, I tend to\nbe a person who actually\
    \ retreats.\nAnd here's what happens to me.\nI don't really want to address it,\
    \ so I ensure that it's there.\nAnd here's what happens to me.\nI generally get\
    \ bitter about the other person not seeing the thing that's in their life.\nLike,\
    \ how do they live with themselves?\nHow can they not see this?\nAnd I'm not going\
    \ to tell them about it, but how can they not recognize this?\nWhat kind of a\
    \ person are they?\nThey don't see this is going on in their life.\nAnd then,\
    \ not only am I bitter at them about it, then I get kind of swelled up with a\
    \ little\nbit of self-righteousness because I'm enduring it.\nYou know, I'm so\
    \ patient and persevering.\nI put up with this other human being who doesn't even\
    \ recognize what's going on in their life.\nAnd all of a sudden, I'm wonderful.\n\
    I'm bitter at them.\nAnd what's happening is I never address it.\nThis continues\
    \ to spiral in my life.\nI make decisions that are destructive for me or for this\
    \ relationship.\nAnd I'm poisoning the relationship because I never deal with\
    \ it.\nMaybe you have a familiar pattern in you or in your life as well.\nNow,\
    \ when Jesus talks to people, he's asked the question about the most important\
    \ stuff.\nHe tells people, look, here's the biggest stuff we got going on.\nLove\
    \ God with everything you've got and love your neighbor as yourself.\nAnd then\
    \ there's this big, long conversation about who's my neighbor and who doesn't.\n\
    It's like, if you can name them, they're your neighbor.\nIf you can identify a\
    \ person, they're your neighbor.\nIf they're a human being, they're your neighbor.\n\
    It's kind of what it comes down to.\nWhich means that people who are followers\
    \ of Jesus.\nAnd I realize some of you are like, I'm still not sure about this.\n\
    I'm investigating it.\nI'm not sure I'm ready to do that.\nI get that.\nBut for\
    \ followers of Jesus, there is an obligation to always love our neighbors, which\
    \ is so\nunbelievably difficult.\nBecause maybe Jesus didn't know our neighbors.\n\
    Like, really?\nI got to love these people?\nBut if that's true, then love obligates\
    \ us to move toward whatever separates us.\nWhoa, is that hard.\nLove obligates\
    \ us to move toward whatever separates us.\nWhoa, is that hard?\nLove obligates\
    \ us to move toward whatever separates us.\nLove obligates us to move toward whatever\
    \ separates us.\nAnd I would say, which is so crucially important here is, this\
    \ has to be done in humility and\ngentleness.\nLove obligates us to move toward\
    \ whatever separates us in humility and gentleness.\nBut what do we do with that?\n\
    I mean, most of us, when it comes to like truth-filled, hard truth conversations,\
    \ we\nlearned a formula that I just want to tell you, I just, it's so lame.\n\
    It's the most unbelievably lame formula.\nIt's the most unbelievably lame formula.\n\
    And I'm going to show it to you, and all of you are probably familiar with it,\
    \ whether,\nyou know, high school students probably got it, like at some point\
    \ in some like leadership\ndevelopment thing in your school.\nThey showed you\
    \ how to do it when you have to have a confrontation or a hard conversation\n\
    with someone else.\nYou got, I guarantee you got it.\nYou get it in, like, the,\
    \ your first, you know, like work orientation thing as an employee\nof some big\
    \ company.\nIf you have to have a hard conversation with someone, I want you to\
    \ employ this technique.\nIt's called the compliment sandwich.\nHave you guys\
    \ heard of this thing before?\nYes.\nRight?\nAnd it just goes like this, tell\
    \ someone a really nice compliment.\nYou know, everybody likes you.\nYou're really\
    \ wonderful.\nAlso, you're a horrible person.\nAnd also, but, but, but also everybody\
    \ says you have a nice tan, and we all agree, and it's just, we all, so anyway,\
    \ that's how that goes.\nNow, anybody who's ever had the compliment sandwich done\
    \ to them, as soon as you feel it coming, it's like this is the most fake, manipulative,\
    \ flattery kind of thing.\nAnd as soon as you hear but or any of its other synonyms,\
    \ although there's some things we need to work on, the only thing you hear is\
    \ that.\nAnd then you hear this compliment at the end, and it's like, it's like\
    \ the worst, grossest feeling kind of like I'm trying to smooth over a hard thing\
    \ I had to tell you because you were afraid to say it, and so it becomes sort\
    \ of really difficult, right?\nEverybody's had this experience, or at least you've\
    \ been told to do it this way, and you can feel yourself doing it, and it's like,\
    \ this is a very lame way to do this.\nIn fact, let me point this out to make\
    \ this even clearer.\nWhen you order a sandwich, you order a sandwich by the contents\
    \ that are between the bread.\nAre you with me?\nYou do not order a sandwich by\
    \ the bread first.\nYou don't go in and order a sourdough sandwich.\nYou order\
    \ a turkey sandwich, and they go, what kind of bread do you want?\nI want it on\
    \ sourdough, or I want it on wheat, or I want it on rye.\nTo that point, this\
    \ is not a compliment sandwich.\nThis is a butt sandwich.\nAnd that's nasty.\n\
    Can we agree that that is just, that's lame?\nIt feels like flattery and manipulation,\
    \ and it's this compliment, it's like this is what this feels like to us, and\
    \ it's so unbelievably disingenuous.\nIt's something that hurts.\nIt hurts us,\
    \ and it's so fake, and it is so ineffective, and far more effective, according\
    \ to research, better than a butt sandwich is not a compliment, but a commitment.\n\
    It's a commitment to the person and to the relationship.\nWay more important than\
    \ a little bit of like buttering them up for a hard thing is to tell them, look,\
    \ I really care about you.\nLook, receptivity to hard truth, the way we kind of\
    \ talk about it.\nIt's always based on the degree to which the confronted person\
    \ is convinced that they are loved and supported by the one who is doing the confronting.\n\
    The receptivity to a hard truth is always based on the degree to which the confronted\
    \ person feels loved and supported by the one doing the confronting themselves.\n\
    Does that make sense?\nIn other words, it's way better to say, look, I'm in this\
    \ with you, as opposed to, I really like you.\nGive you an example.\nHere's how\
    \ this goes.\nAnd you can try this.\nLots of different ways.\nBecause I love you\
    \ and I'm committed to you, that's how you start the conversation.\nI owe it to\
    \ you to have a direct and honest conversation about some hard stuff.\nThat's\
    \ way better than the compliment, excuse me, the butt sandwich.\nIt's way better\
    \ than that.\nBecause I love you and I'm committed to you, I owe it to you to\
    \ have a direct and honest conversation about some hard stuff in me or about you.\n\
    Here's what's going on with me and I need you to know about it.\nOr here's that\
    \ thing that I've noticed between us that I can't let go any longer because I\
    \ care about us and I care about you.\nIf love moves towards the thing that's\
    \ an obstacle or that thing that whatever is between us, let me just ask you,\
    \ with whom or about what do you need to employ this?\nIf love always moves toward\
    \ that thing that's between us, the obstacle that runs between us, then with whom\
    \ or about what do you need to have this conversation?\nBecause I love you and\
    \ I'm committed to you.\nI owe it to you to have a direct and honest conversation\
    \ about some hard stuff.\nNow, the model for this, by the way, is probably not\
    \ surprising.\nIf you're asked the question, how are we supposed to live or act?\n\
    If you're just like, what's the model for this?\nIt's like, oh, probably, I think\
    \ it's Jesus.\nJesus is the answer, okay?\nIf you're ever asked the question.\n\
    In church, who are we supposed to live like?\nOh, Jesus?\nThat's the answer, okay?\n\
    I just want to let you know, right?\nNow, I want you to suppose for a moment that\
    \ Jesus, who is not insecure, who is not a people pleaser, he's okay with the\
    \ truth.\nHe's like, kind of calls himself, I don't know if you remember this,\
    \ he calls himself the truth.\nHe's like, okay with this.\nBut he comes to us,\
    \ and I just want you to imagine for a moment that he has the same conversation\
    \ with you.\nIt looks like this.\nAgain.\nI'm paraphrasing.\nBear with me.\nThis\
    \ is Jesus to you.\nBecause I love you, and I'm committed to you, I owe it to\
    \ you to have a direct and honest conversation about some hard stuff.\nThere's\
    \ some stuff in your life that you're not equipped to handle alone.\nIt's what\
    \ has kept us apart.\nIt's called sin, and you may not see it, but it's there.\n\
    You may not even want to call it sin.\nBut it's there.\nAnd at times it tells\
    \ you you're worthless, unwanted, and you're a stranger.\nAt other times it fills\
    \ you with a blind self-righteousness, enabling you to cause others to believe\
    \ that they're worthless and unwanted too.\nAnd to break free from it, you have\
    \ to face it.\nYou have to see it for what it is.\nYou have to face it.\nAnd then\
    \ you have to let me take it from you.\nYou have to release it.\nBecause this\
    \ is what the cross is for.\nBecause I love you and I'm committed to you, I owe\
    \ it to you to have a direct and honest conversation about some hard stuff.\n\
    Thank you.\nThank you.\nThis very idea is what is remembered.\nThis very idea\
    \ is what is remembered.\nThis very idea is what is remembered.\nThis very idea\
    \ is what is remembered across the globe for centuries.\nIt is recalled in some\
    \ cases weekly by many church communities.\nWe do it about monthly, but it is\
    \ remembered in communion.\nJesus, with his own disciples, says, look, there's\
    \ some stuff that's been between us that I'm going to put to death on the cross.\n\
    And so as he gathers with his disciples on the night of his betrayal, he gathers\
    \ them together.\nAnd after he's looking at the Passover feast, all the elements\
    \ of the Passover feast.\nAnd after he had taken the cross, he says, look, I'm\
    \ going to put it on the cross.\nAnd after he had taken the bread and he had given\
    \ thanks, he broke it and he gave it to his disciples, saying, this is my body\
    \ which is given for you.\nRemember, he's foreshadowing the cross here.\nIn the\
    \ same way, the Bible says that he took the cup, saying, this is the cup of the\
    \ new covenant in my blood.\nAnd we use the word covenant.\nCovenant is a word\
    \ that means a sacred agreement of love and trust, like a marriage.\nAnd he said,\
    \ look, there's a new covenant, a new agreement between God and people that's\
    \ been fused together now because of this cup, this blood.\nSo whenever you eat,\
    \ he says, this is the cup of the new covenant.\nThis is the new covenant in my\
    \ blood.\nAnd whenever you eat this bread and you drink this cup, do it and remember\
    \ me.\nThere's a hard truth.\nPeople have been separated from God by their sin,\
    \ and I'm going to put it to death on the cross.\nAnd so we're invited in confession\
    \ and in honesty and in truth to meet Jesus in this moment and to remember him\
    \ in communion.\nSo that's what we're going to do.\nWould you pray with me as\
    \ we deal with that hard truth?\nAnd that we become more acquainted with the joy\
    \ and the peace and the love of Jesus as we do it.\nFather, we're grateful that\
    \ you aren't a people pleaser, that you aren't trying to flatter us.\nAnd that\
    \ you love us with a love we could never even possibly fathom.\nSo Father, we\
    \ confess to you, whatever it is that's in our life,\nthat we've allowed to be\
    \ there,\nthat we can't handle anymore.\nJesus, as we go to remember you in communion,\n\
    might we come to an understanding of your deep, compassionate love for us\nthat\
    \ would take away anything that separates us from you.\nAnd we place our faith\
    \ in you.\nAnd we remember in these symbols, the bread and the cup,\nhow you have\
    \ come to meet us.\nAnd that's the truth.\nSo Jesus, it's in your name that we\
    \ pray.\nAmen.\nWhen you're ready, instructions for communion are on the screen.\n\
    When you're ready to come forward, you can do so.\n"

    \ to you. And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night. Oh,\
    \ God, the battle belongs to you. And if you were for me, who could be against\
    \ me? For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you. When all I see are the ashes,\
    \ you see the beauty. Yes, you do. When all I see is a cross, God, you see the\
    \ empty door. Oh, so I'll sing through the night. So when I'm high, I'll ride\
    \ on my knees, with my head lifted high. Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. And\
    \ every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night. Oh, God, the battle\
    \ belongs to you. And, oh, mighty fortress, you go before us. Nothing can stand\
    \ against the power of our God. You shine in the shadow. You win every battle.\
    \ Nothing can stand against the power of our God. Oh, almighty fortress, you go\

    \ belongs to you. And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night.\
    \ Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. Oh,\
    \ you are holy, yes. Oh, we bring you peace. A thousand generations falling down\
    \ in worship. Oh, you are holy, yes. Oh, we bring you peace. Oh, you are holy,\
    \ yes. Oh, we bring you peace. Falling down in worship. Sing the song of ages\
    \ through the night. It's all gone before us. It's all we'll believe. We'll sing\
    \ the song of ages through the night. Your name, your name is the highest. Your\
    \ name is the greatest. Your name, Santa, both and all. All grows into millions.\
    \ All powers and positions. Your name, Santa, both and all. And the angels cry,\
    \ Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy, holy forever. And\
    \ if you've been forgiven, And if you've buried tears, Sing the song forever through\
    \ the night. And if you walk in freedom, And if you bear His name, Sing the song\
    \ forever through the night. Sing the song forever as He did, And the angels cry,\
    \ Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy, holy forever. Holy,\
    \ holy forever. Hear people sing, Holy, to the King of Kings. Holy, you will always\
    \ be. Holy, holy forever. Your name, your name is the highest. Your name is the\
    \ greatest. Your name, Santa, both and all. All grows into millions. All powers\
    \ and positions. Your name, Santa, both and all. Your name is the highest. Your\
    \ name is the greatest. Your name stands above them all. All grows into millions.\
    \ All powers and positions. Your name stands above them all. And the angels cry,\
    \ And the angels cry, Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy,\
    \ holy forever. Hear your people sing, Hear your people sing, Holy, to the King\
    \ of Kings. Holy, you will always be. Holy, holy forever. Holy, holy forever.\
    \ You will always be. Holy, holy forever. You are holy, yes. So holy. Amen. Well,\
    \ we can sing that song with confidence. Knowing that God is holy, holy forever,\
    \ that His name will last forever, that He is set apart. The description in the\
    \ book of Revelation is that the angels bow down and worship Him and they say,\
    \ holy, holy, holy. Yet He's a God that cares about us. That's involved in our\
    \ lives, that knows the individual aspects of what we're going through and wants\
    \ to help us grow and transform us into the person that He wants us to be. We\
    \ got to celebrate this last night as we had our rooted graduates here as they\
    \ ended their 10-week experience and celebrated them. And we saw the transformation.\
    \ We heard stories and story after story of people that said, I signed up for\
    \ this and I was hoping for this. And God did this. The individual transformation\
    \ that takes place in each life is because of a God that is holy. It's also because\
    \ of a people that have said, we're going to be generous in our response to what\
    \ God is doing and we're going to jump in in any way that we feel led. And it's\
    \ your generosity and your worship and your offering that you have brought that\
    \ allows things like Rooted to take place. And for those of you that are in life\
    \ groups, you know that Rooted is the first 10 weeks of a life group and you get\
    \ connected to your church and the people around you and God and learn more about\
    \ yourself. We get to see that transformation take place because of the generosity\
    \ here at Harbor Point. And if you want to jump in and participate in that, there's\
    \ ways on the screens behind me that you can jump in and play a part in that generosity.\
    \ But I want you to see in just a minute on the screens behind me you're going\
    \ to watch Cardboard Testimonies. And if you know about Rooted, Cardboard Testimony\
    \ is a chance to kind of look back on where we were 10 weeks ago, what we were\
    \ as that person and what we were experiencing going through and how we've been\
    \ transformed and changed by God, a holy God that cares about us today. So you're\
    \ going to see that in the next song in just a little bit. Would you pray with\
    \ me as we continue in our service? Father, we thank you. We thank you, God, that\
    \ you are holy. We sing, we raise our hands, we proclaim that truth through song\
    \ today knowing that you are holy and you care about us. You want to transform\
    \ our lives because you have a picture of who we can be. And Lord, you're engaged\
    \ and in our lives. And we praise you for that. Father, we respond in our offering\
    \ now as a worship to you. And God, we give it to you because we know that you\
    \ can take it and use it to continue to transform more and more lives. We thank\
    \ you for who you are. We ask that you be with us now and shape us and form us\
    \ as we continue in our service and worship today. It's in your son's name we\
    \ pray. Amen. I'm going to sing a little bit of the Lord's Prayer. I'm going to\

    \ together. Welcome to Harbor Point. There are so many dads throughout the room.\
    \ Happy Father's Day to you all. Beautiful people all throughout the room. Why\
    \ don't you turn to your neighbor, give somebody a high five. You can grab a seat.\
    \ Oh, wow, you're taking this serious. I'm serious. The whole thing is about being\
    \ serious. Apparently you're not ready to be serious. That may lower this so you\
    \ can hear my joke appropriately. I can hear it. Okay. All right, I've got to\
    \ put mine down a little bit. Is that your first joke? That was it. I don't get\
    \ it. Okay. I've got to get in the zone. Like I said, I'm not at a disadvantage,\
    \ I laugh at my own jokes, but I'm competitive, so the two things are going head\
    \ to head here. Give me your worst. Look at me. I'm right here. I am right here\
    \ and you're right here and we're crossing our eyes. We're crossing our eyes.\
    \ Elevating the humor level to the next. When I cross my eyes so I can't remember\
    \ my joke. Okay, I remember now. After you read it, you remembered it. Did I get\
    \ a point there? Yeah. What did one eye say to the other eye? You got it. Did\
    \ I get a point there? Yeah. What did one eye say to the other eye? I don't know.\
    \ There's something between us that smells. Does a quiver count? He's quivering.\
    \ You're quivering. Oh, that's a laugh? Yeah. Already? It's a wash. Let's see\
    \ here. I'm reading a horror story in Braille. Something bad is going to happen.\
    \ I can feel it. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you for moving that. Now I can see\
    \ your face. What do you call a paper airplane? I can't fly. I do not know. Ready?\
    \ Stationary. Did you have a bad morning? What's going on? What's going on? The\
    \ morning would be great if I heard some humor around here, but apparently that's\
    \ not what we're doing. I went to buy some camouflage pants either day. Okay.\
    \ I couldn't find any. How? You're terrible. Stop throwing stuff at me. I asked\
    \ the librarian if the library had any books on paranoia. She leaned in and whispered,\
    \ They're right behind you. That's two points for you that I lost on my own joke.\
    \ Yeah. This is easy. At this point, we're doing it. You can't resist this right\
    \ here. If you feel like someone is watching you, you're not alone. You're not\
    \ alone. Dude, that was totally for you. What did Mario say to Princess Peach\
    \ when he dumped her? Mario. It's not you. It's a me, Mario. No, come on. I love\
    \ you so many more. What's the difference between curtains and toilet paper? I\
    \ don't know. So it was you. That's it. I'm happy to go out on that one. Thank\
    \ you. Alright. Yeah. Top shelf humor for you guys that are new with us every\
    \ week. We do that kind of stuff. We just set the bar. I know it's incredible.\
    \ Great to be with you guys. Happy Father's Day. It is Father's Day in case you\
    \ didn't know. Happy Father's Day. I don't want to compare days for parents here.\
    \ If we did that on Mother's Day, it would have been like a wave. I just want\
    \ to say one more time. Happy Father's Day. Yeah, right. Exactly. This is my 20th\
    \ Father's Day, which is really bizarre to think about. You're just like, wow,\
    \ I didn't know he was that old. Now you know. But yeah, my 20th Father's Day.\
    \ In all seriousness, I just want to tell you, and this is really, really crucial.\
    \ You guys, dads matter. The church and the world needs fathers and grandfathers.\
    \ It needs fathers and father figures. So it matters. If you're wondering if you're\
    \ doing a great job, you'll probably never know if you're doing a great job. But\
    \ let me just say if you're showing up, that's half of it. The rest of it you\
    \ can figure out. Just showing up is half of it. And so I'm grateful for you guys.\
    \ Keep being dads and grandfathers and father figures to so many people. We need\
    \ you guys. All right? Cool. Good? Yeah. All right. If you're new with us, my\
    \ name is Jeff. I'm one of the pastors here. I want to tell you, if you're new,\
    \ again, I know there's a lot of places you could be. There's like brunch plans\
    \ you had. There was all kinds of stuff you were planning on doing today. I was\
    \ in church and it was like, I gotta go, I guess. Or something like that. Or maybe\
    \ you were coerced or tricked or however bribed you wound up here. I want to let\
    \ you know that my favorite thing about our church is the people you're sitting\
    \ around. There's a lot of great stuff that happens on this stage, but the best\
    \ stuff that happens in our church is always with the people that you're sitting\
    \ around. And people will tell me over and over again their favorite thing is\
    \ the people they met. They'll say, I'm like, did you not? There's something else\
    \ going on on the stage here. Yeah, yeah, that was fine. But the people I met,\
    \ they were great. They just seemed like a place where I could come and show up\
    \ and kind of be myself and all that sort of stuff. And I'm like, I'm going to\
    \ go. I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\

    \ And to the degree that it's sacrificially, joyfully generous somewhere else.\
    \ Find somewhere else that's making an eternal difference in the world. And give\
    \ sacrificially to it. Because there are some things that God can only do when\
    \ we're with our generosity, with our sacrificial generosity. You want to join\
    \ the generosity journey here? Great. If you don't, don't let that be a reason\
    \ to not be generous. Period. Find a way to be generous. Everybody cool? Does\
    \ that make sense? All right. We on board with that? Okay, cool. Yeah. We're a\
    \ little more tepid on that. Not quite as excited about that. Okay, that's right.\
    \ I want to let you guys know, by the way, you're looking at our incredible horse\
    \ trough right here behind us. It is, we're going to do some baptisms a little\
    \ bit later. I'm going to explain what that is. If you're wondering about that,\
    \ some of you came here like, I'm not sure what about baptism is. That's a weird\
    \ thing these Christian people do. You're going to see it. And some of you might\
    \ be like, I should do that. By the way, it's not like an oil change you have\
    \ to do every 3000 miles. I'm like, well, I haven't done it in a while. I guess\
    \ I should do it again. You only need to do it once, you know, but whatever. But\
    \ anyway, let me just see. The water is nice and tepid. And no one will burn themselves\
    \ and it's not cold. Okay, a lot to get through. Here we go. I have to zoom through\
    \ this message. We're in the middle of a series. Let's start right here. I'm going\
    \ to, remember everybody be really quiet. I want you to hear something. When you\
    \ know the name of this song, if you know it, just raise your hand. Don't shout\
    \ it, but just name it. If you know the name of it, okay? It's going to be going\
    \ on for a little while. Listen. You get credit. I'll call on you in a second.\
    \ Listen to this melody. Jump to the next one. This song is 15 minutes long. I'm\
    \ only going to show you like little chunks of it. But notice how it builds. Stay\
    \ with it. Once you get the melody, you can hum it. Go to the next one. Yep. There\
    \ you go. Jump to the next. We're now in minute nine of this song. Last one. All\
    \ right, that's good. Okay. Now, the song, like I said, is 15 minutes long. It's\
    \ going to be going on for a little while. Listen to this melody. Jump to the\
    \ next one. Jump to the next. The song, like I said, is 15 minutes long. And that's\
    \ all it does. The song just builds from that little phrase. And it just builds\
    \ the whole time. All the way through for 15 minutes. Back here. You raise your\
    \ hand. Do you know what that song is? Bolero by Ravel. Maurice Ravel. Yep. Now,\
    \ here. Yeah. Let's close in prayer. That's it. Let's get some baptisms going.\
    \ Now, that song, again, like, some of you, how many of you guys heard that song?\
    \ Maybe you didn't know what it was. Yeah, that song. Everybody's heard that song.\
    \ It's one of the most famous classical pieces, you know, of recent past. I mean,\
    \ it's really famous. But the whole song, again, is just this single phrase over\
    \ and over again. The whole work adds, builds, adds, builds, until it gets to\
    \ the whole orchestra doing the same thing over and over again. In other words,\
    \ to understand that song, all you would need to do is just understand that song.\
    \ All you would need is that one phrase and to see it built over and over and\
    \ over again. We'll come back to that in a minute. Three weeks ago, we started\
    \ a series, and we just sort of said, look, let's reimagine the Bible a little\
    \ bit, which is such a strange piece of ancient literature written over, you know,\
    \ 1,500 years, 40 or so different authors in different places and settings and\
    \ times. And it's hard for us to read the Bible because we're not reading it as\
    \ the original audience member. We're 21st century, Western kind of world people\
    \ looking back at this thing. We're not the original audience. And the, like,\
    \ one of the sort of Bible scholar, a guy named John Walton says, look, the Bible\
    \ is for us, 100% Bible is for us. But it's not to us. The Bible was, was definitely\
    \ written for us, but it's not written to us. And so that makes it a little bit\
    \ of a challenge. But we know Christians regard, they have high regard for the\
    \ Bible, they'll say things like this, about this is the Bible saying, this is\
    \ what people believe about the Bible, it's in the Bible. Hebrews 412. For the\
    \ word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates\
    \ even to the dividing soul and the spirit, joints and marrow, it judges the thoughts\
    \ and attitudes of the heart. Now, if people believe, Hebrews 412 just says, if\
    \ people believe that it actually did all this stuff, that's a pretty high, that's\
    \ a pretty high level of importance for some words. That they actually can do\
    \ all of these things. So Christians are known for people who have a high regard\
    \ for the Bible. But some of you might be like, look, the Bible is maybe sort\
    \ of wonderful, but it just sort of feels like a collection of mythological stories\
    \ and I don't really know about that. Others of you might say, well, the Bible\
    \ might be valuable, but it just, I mean, come on, let's get it with the times\
    \ here. It's for different people. You just said, Jeff, it's not to us, it's written\
    \ to people a long time ago. Maybe it needs a little updating, a little freshening\
    \ up. For a lot of people, that's sort of their belief. Other people might say,\
    \ look, and this might be a larger portion of us. People are like, look, the Bible\
    \ is really good, but it's so unapproachable. It's just so very much unapproachable.\
    \ And as we think about it, the Bible, as we've been saying, maybe one of the\
    \ ways we got to reimagine or rethink about the Bible is less as a book and more\
    \ as a bookstore or maybe perhaps like a library with different sections. Because\
    \ if we were to look at it, here are the different sections of the Bible. All\
    \ of them have different kinds of writing styles. Each one of them requires its\
    \ own unique way of looking at it. You couldn't read the writings on narrative\
    \ the same way you'd read the writings on prophecy or gospels or etc. Things like\
    \ that. So once again, between law and narrative and prayer and wisdom and prophecy\
    \ and gospels and letters and apocalyptic writing, they're all different styles\
    \ of writing. And what we've been saying throughout the series is this. Each section\
    \ of the Bible requires its own unique approach to understand it as best as possible.\
    \ In fact, so much confusion about the Bible often comes with the fact that people\
    \ have complicated it by coming to a particular section with the wrong approach.\
    \ And all we're trying to do in this particular series is to kind of say, let's\
    \ just try to make sure our approach is lined up with the thing that we're reading.\
    \ Now, one section of the Bible, I think is probably the toughest section of all\
    \ of the Bible writing to read. It is complicated largely because a lot of it\
    \ is written in poetic language. It references things that we have no idea what\
    \ they're talking about because again, for us but not to us. But as we look at\
    \ it, I just want to show you when we get to this kind of reading, what you're\
    \ going to see over and over again is a phrase. Over and over and over again like\
    \ Polaroid that starts small and begins to build and build and build. And I'll\
    \ show you what that is in a moment. But when you read this most confusing kind\
    \ of writing, which is called prophetic writing in the Bible, when you read it,\
    \ it is so helpful to understand that single phrase. Now most people, so by the\
    \ way, to just give you a sense, in the Bible there are 16 books of the Bible\
    \ that are written that would fall into this category, prophetic writing. Four\
    \ major prophets and 12 minor prophets. They're not because they're minor because\
    \ they're like less important. It just usually has to do with their length, mostly.\
    \ But anyway, here's a list of them. The ones that are in the yellow, the yellow\
    \ orange color, that's all the major prophets. So Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.\
    \ Daniel is the other one that has an asterisk there because some people put that\
    \ book in particular in another category. But that's, you know, thank you for\
    \ kneeling down by the way. That was really helpful. No one saw you. Yeah. Yeah,\
    \ that was great. Anyway, I know you're trying not to have anybody draw attention\
    \ to that. It's okay. Anyways, there we go. The other 12 of those are simply referred\
    \ to sometimes as just the 12. You'll see it actually referred to as the 12. These\
    \ are the minor prophets. Now, for most people when you talk about prophetic writing,\
    \ most people have the impression, and we talk about prophecy, if you looked it\
    \ up like a definition of prophecy or prophetic writing, inevitably the first\
    \ definition you would find would be talking about or predicting events in the\
    \ future that happen at some point, you know, at some point in the future. But\
    \ here's what's so interesting. When it comes to the prophetic writing in the\
    \ Bible, only one percent of the predictions that are in the Bible have yet to\
    \ occur. There are lots of people that you might know or come across. You might\
    \ even be a person who really loves the idea of future prediction in the Bible,\
    \ and there's definitely some of that, but it's really an overwhelming minority\
    \ of the amount of things that are in the Bible about future prediction. Only\
    \ one percent of stuff hasn't happened yet. Here's some really conservative Bible\
    \ scholars on the subject. These guys wrote a book called How to Read the Bible\
    \ for All It's Worth. Really good book. It's not thrilling, not a page-turner,\
    \ not great summer pool reading, but it is in fact really helpful. But anyway,\
    \ it often happens that many Christians refer to the prophetic books only for\
    \ their predictions about the coming of Jesus. Now, what people would read the\
    \ Bible, you know, sort of prophecy books for is they would like try to read it\
    \ only as if it's anticipating Jesus, who doesn't show up in his ministry for\
    \ about, depending on which prophet you're reading, between 400 and 700 years.\
    \ So he's saying, these are what these guys are saying, it happens that many Christians\
    \ refer to the prophetic books only for predictions about the coming of Jesus,\
    \ as though the prediction of events far distant from their own day was the main\
    \ concern of these prophets. In fact, using the prophets in this way is highly\
    \ selective. Consider the following statistics. Less than 2% of Old Testament\
    \ prophecy. Old Testament is the part of the Bible that concerns God and his relationship\
    \ with his own people before the ministry of Jesus, life and ministry of Jesus\
    \ and the early church. That's the New Testament. Old Testament is about God and\
    \ his relationship with his people before the ministry and life of Jesus. Now,\
    \ less than 2% of Old Testament prophecy is messianic. That is to say, referring\
    \ to a messiah that's supposed to come. Less than 1% concerns events yet to come\
    \ in our time. The prophets then did indeed announce the future, but it was usually\
    \ the immediate future of Israel, which is the northern kingdom of Israel, Judah,\
    \ which is the southern kingdom, and other nations surrounding them that they\
    \ announced rather than our future. Meaning there's so many people have an obsession\
    \ with only about 1% of the content of the writing. Which means that when it comes\
    \ to prophetic writing, it's referring to something else altogether. In fact,\
    \ something that would be way more helpful to look at it when you are, if you\
    \ ever come across some of this writing in the Bible, is to look at it a little\
    \ bit differently. Now to say it simply, prophetic writing is about God's word\
    \ spoken through God's spokesperson to God's people. That's the simplest way to\
    \ talk about what prophetic writing is. A prophet is simply a person who's been\
    \ appointed by God to speak his words to his people, and it's like I said only\
    \ rarely is it about future stuff. Like that hasn't happened. It's very rare.\
    \ When it comes to the actual tone of this writing, when we're talking about the\
    \ prophetic writing tone, it's highly confrontational. It is unbelievably confrontational.\
    \ Because God's people were intended to have a relationship with God that looks\
    \ like wedding vows. We talked about this in the beginning of the series about\
    \ what it means, what's called the covenant. And there's covenant, what are called\
    \ stipulations or vows, and they're saying we're going to be, it's going to be\
    \ you and us, God. We're going to be together. And they set up these terms and\
    \ they're going to have this agreement. And the prophets come around and they\
    \ go, hey, wait a second. You guys are, you guys are supposed to keep up your\
    \ end of the bargain and sort of be a part of this relationship in the way that\
    \ you intended. So it's always confrontational. They're like, look, you stopped\
    \ caring for the poor, the orphan and the widow, which is like the trifecta of\
    \ the most marginalized people. You aren't caring for the poor, the orphan and\
    \ the widow anymore. Or you've made some other idols and you're worshiping them,\
    \ or you're practicing some kind of permission, you know, immorality, whatever\
    \ it might be for yourselves. And so the prophets words are not welcome words.\
    \ People aren't like, yay, a prophet's here. They're always being confronted.\
    \ In fact, here's an example of some people having a conversation in the Bible\
    \ about prophets and how they feel about them. Check this out. This is in 1 Kings\
    \ 22 verse 7. Jehoshaphat asked, is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here\
    \ whom we can inquire of? The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, oh, there is\
    \ still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because\
    \ he never prophesized anything good about me, but always bad. I don't want to\
    \ ask that guy. He always says things I don't want to hear. This is over and over\
    \ again. To be a prophet is to be a person who's generally hated because all that\
    \ person does is show up and say, you guys aren't getting it right over and over\
    \ again. Christy Anya Buile in her book, literally says it like this. I love this.\
    \ God used prophets to speak the cold hard truth to God's cold hard people. Over\
    \ and over again, you see this and what it is, the content of the prophetic messages\
    \ is always what people needed to hear, but what they rarely wanted to hear. It's\
    \ what people needed to hear, but what they rarely wanted to hear. Now when we\
    \ talk about the prophets, it's important to understand, we talked about this\
    \ in the second week of the series, about the idea of this last week, about how\
    \ they all the whole Bible fits into a giant narrative framework. And I want to\
    \ show you what that is. Once again, if you weren't here with us here, it is really\
    \ quickly. First, God is the good creator and sustainer of all things. Second,\
    \ God's people, God and people form an unlikely and unequal partnership with him.\
    \ Third, people break the partnership with God. At some point, they're like, we're\
    \ kind of tired of this. Four, life apart from God results in exile, means they\
    \ get deported out of their own homes, or invasion, people come in and take them\
    \ out like they take them over. Five, by the way, people regret their decision.\
    \ And then six, God restores the partnership. You can see this cover to cover\
    \ in the Bible. If you get this, if you get this sort of framework, you understand\
    \ the Bible a lot. They see you don't need to kneel down. They see you don't need\
    \ to kneel down. Just walk right out. That's there you go. Just there you go.\
    \ I don't know. So now what I said was helpful for us before is this, and I meant\
    \ it, and it is a little bit goofy, but if you think about the basic plot line\
    \ as a romantic comedy, it really helps you to understand, which I know a lot\
    \ of you are going to be watching romantic comedy on Father's Day. I just know\
    \ it's a typical tradition in a lot of people's homes. No, just kidding. Now,\
    \ when you talk about the prophets, when they show up, it's the same part in a\
    \ movie, in a romantic comedy when the person, the protagonist breaks up with\
    \ whoever they're with. He breaks up with her, she breaks up with him, they go\
    \ back to their old life. Inevitably what you have is another person will say,\
    \ are you crazy? That's the best thing that ever happened to you. Why? It's a\
    \ secondary character, tertiary character is like, you should not have broken\
    \ up with that person. You've never been better in your whole life. I can't believe\
    \ you broke up with that person. You've got to get back with them. That's what\
    \ the prophets say in these chunks of that story. The people are like, I'm done\
    \ with this partnership. And they end up in sort of exile or invasion. And then\
    \ people regret their decision. The prophets are like, no, no, no, wait, come\
    \ back, come back, come back. That's the language. But there are other pictures\
    \ of God's people and their relationship too. That isn't just sort of this romantic\
    \ comedy kind of picture, although that's really prominent. In fact, that's the\
    \ third most used sort of reference to God and his people is as a husband and\
    \ a wife. That's actually how he describes his relationship. The first most used\
    \ picture is of a shepherd and a sheep. This is the relationship God has with\
    \ his people. You see it over and over again in the prophets. But the second most\
    \ used one, which is maybe particularly significant today, is that it's a father\
    \ and child. Throughout the writing of the prophets, there is this constant theme.\
    \ Again, you see that sort of begins to get developed. And one of the things is\
    \ as a father and a child. Here's Hosea chapter 11. Verse one says this, when\
    \ Israel was a child, I loved him. Notice the language. And out of Egypt, I called\
    \ my son, but the more they were called, the more they went away from me. You\
    \ get this very clear picture of what prophecy actually is. Israel is called a\
    \ child and then he called out of Egypt, I called my son, but then they, they\
    \ wandered away. They broke up with me. Now what's so incredible to think about\
    \ this is that if you have a picture of this idea of this sort of confrontational\
    \ tone, but as a father to his own kids, you could describe that or characterize\
    \ it as simply tough love. Now some of you have been, someone just treated you\
    \ like a jerk and they're like, that's just tough love. That might not have been\
    \ true. Like being a jerk is not the same thing as tough love. Just make sure\
    \ we're all on the same page. The operative thing here is love. It is not licensed\
    \ to be a jerk, but part of loving another person sometimes is having the willingness\
    \ to say the tough things. Having willingness to say the tough things. That's\
    \ different than the way the world is now. The world says if you, if you, the\
    \ world would sort of basically categorize love as a kind of blind acceptance\
    \ and aloof permissiveness. And if you were ever to say something, I don't know\
    \ if that's okay, then that makes you an unloving person in the world's eyes.\
    \ But we know that there is something really true about the idea that sometimes\
    \ we need to hear the tough things because of love. And when we encounter them\
    \ in the Bible, these tough things, it's so unbelievably important that you and\
    \ I understand that the beating heart of the Bible is the calling of wayward kids\
    \ home to their father. The language might get really harsh. The words might get\
    \ really tough. And if you were to extract just a little one or two of those words\
    \ out of the Bible, you'd be like, what's this Bible all about? And that's true.\
    \ But if you're to look at it in a bigger, broader sense that this is about God\
    \ calling wayward kids home to the father, then it becomes a little bit clearer\
    \ what we're doing. And that refrain starts to take on a little bit more shape.\
    \ And there's a command that does all of the prophets build their particular message\
    \ on. And it's one word. It's the word that just starts out very, it starts really\
    \ sort of simple and clean, and it just keeps getting built on and expanding.\
    \ And that word is this word in Hebrew, teshuvah. Over and over and over again.\
    \ The root word of teshuvah is this simply this word, turn. All the time. In fact,\
    \ you can keep seeing it throughout the writing. You just see this word turn comes\
    \ up over and over again. Return or turn. What this looks like in the book of\
    \ Hosea, which I'll show you in a second, is this. After a long series of painful,\
    \ tough love things that God is saying through his prophet Hosea to his people.\
    \ I mean, if you were to read the subject headings in the book of Hosea, you would\
    \ just see what the subject headings are added way later. You just see things\
    \ like punishment or anger or frustration that God has for Israel. It's like,\
    \ these aren't the ones that people get tattooed or needle point onto a thing.\
    \ These are like, wow, this is really harsh stuff. It is really harsh. No question\
    \ about it. But after a long series of this painful, tough love stuff, then comes\
    \ this promise. The very last chapter of Hosea looks like this. I'm going to show\
    \ you this. Notice the language. Hosea 14. Return. Shuvah. Return Israel to the\
    \ Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall. Take your words with you and\
    \ return. Shuvah to the Lord. Say to him, forgive all our sins and receive us\
    \ graciously that we may offer the fruit of our lives. Remember, this is the prophet\
    \ speaking to the people in God's voice. Say, forgive our sins, receive us graciously.\
    \ Assyria cannot save us. We'll not mount warhorses. We'll never again say our\
    \ gods to what our own hands have made. What they're saying here is this. They\
    \ would make a thing out of wood or stone or something like that or iron and they\
    \ would say, this is our God. Make it and then call it. This is our God. We just\
    \ made this. What they're saying is we're not going to have these idols anymore.\
    \ We're not going to ever say again our gods to what our own hands have made.\
    \ For in you, the fatherless find compassion. It continues. Then God's voice switches\
    \ to his own voice. I'll heal their waywardness and love them freely for my anger\
    \ has turned away from them. I'll be like the dew to Israel. He, Israel, will\
    \ blossom like a lily, like a cedar of Lebanon. He will send down his roots. Who\
    \ is wise? Let them realize these things. What you get is that the invitation\
    \ is a coming to confess and anticipating what God will do to receive them. That's\
    \ what that is. That's the words of the prophet at the end of that book. Let me\
    \ just ask you though, just right now in this moment, a tough love message from\
    \ God to me might say something. Turn from blank. Now you might be wrong, but\
    \ if you had to guess, if there was a tough love message to you right now from\
    \ God, it might be like this. Turn from blank. What is it? Is it a habit? Is it\
    \ an addiction? Is it a kind of bitterness? Is it a self-righteous kind of judgment\
    \ about other people? Is it a sense of your own kind of elevated, I'm so wonderful,\
    \ isn't it great to be me? It's too bad for everybody else? Is it a thing you\
    \ keep going back to? You can't stop, you just keep going on back to it. You keep\
    \ trying to get away from it and you're, like a lot of us, we kind of give ourselves,\
    \ which just tends to be our typical things. We tend to give ourselves a little\
    \ bit of permission. I'm not that, so I get to do this. We keep going back to\
    \ it. This is true of me. It's true of all of us. Maybe it's, in some cases, it's\
    \ a really good thing. It's like everybody would acknowledge the thing that you\
    \ keep going back to, or the thing that you hold on to is really good, but it's\
    \ become the ultimate thing. And in that sense, it's become something that was\
    \ never intended to become. And maybe God's just sort of saying, maybe you ought\
    \ to turn from that. Shoo, turn. Now it's no surprise. Jesus has the continuation\
    \ of the same message, even in his own teaching and his own ministry. The same\
    \ phrase is. Comes up again. Now remember, here's the Hebrew word for to Shoova\
    \ or turn, Shoov, turn. That word in Greek, when you go to the Old Testament,\
    \ part of the ministry, part of the life of the Bible between God and his people,\
    \ there, you know, all that story before Jesus ministry. And then the life of\
    \ the early church, which is the New Testament. The New Testament is written not\
    \ in Hebrew, but in Greek. And that word looks like this in Greek, metanoia. Now\
    \ when I show you the actual, the actual English version of the word metanoia,\
    \ remember what you're looking at is turn, turn. I'm going to show it to you.\
    \ And some of you will recognize this word, but you've not heard it in this term\
    \ before. That word is repent. Now you've heard this word before, some of you,\
    \ but it sounded like this, repent, repent. There was like some sort of, usually\
    \ it had a really deep South anger kind of attached to it and repent, you know,\
    \ like it's like a big threat, you know, like coming at you. And you heard it\
    \ that way. I just want to say when you look at it from the way that the Bible\
    \ comes at it, it's just simply saying the word metanoia is just a whole life\
    \ U-turn. I was going one direction and I'm done going that direction and I'm\
    \ turning the other way. Metanoia, return. Here's Jesus's own words at the very\
    \ beginning of his ministry in Mark chapter one. The time has come, he said, the\
    \ kingdom of God has come near. By the time it's coming, it's come to fulfillment.\
    \ The kingdom of God has come near. Repent, U-turn and believe the good news.\
    \ Now with that being said, the turn is just when Jesus is inviting people to\
    \ this, what he's saying is remember the big arc of the Bible, you don't have\
    \ to live like orphans anymore. You don't have to live like orphans at all. And\
    \ in that sense, repent isn't a threat, like maybe some of us have heard it or\
    \ characterized it. It's really an invitation to come home. The problem with Jesus\
    \ over and over again is that people look to Jesus and were like, you keep inviting\
    \ the wrong people to come home because they're too far gone. Over and over again,\
    \ Jesus, you keep telling people you can turn back, you can come back and the\
    \ critics of Jesus always were like, wait a second, you can't tell those people\
    \ because they have gone too far. They cannot turn. And maybe that's how you felt\
    \ about yourself. Maybe someone made you feel that way. Maybe you understood that\
    \ God is like, look, he's for some people, but I know what I've done. And every\
    \ single person in this room has some measure of some secrets in here that if\
    \ people found out about him, we would all be devastated. The criticism always\
    \ of Jesus is that he kept associating with people and inviting people who everybody\
    \ else had regarded as too far gone. Over and over again, Jesus reiterates that's\
    \ not possible to be too far gone. What's important to keep in mind in the invitation\
    \ about sort of returning, what's so crucial to keep in mind is returning always\
    \ involves leaving, meaning you can't stay in one place and also be in another.\
    \ Some of you might be going to like Hawaii this summer and we're all jealous\
    \ of you. That's great. We're excited for you to go there, but you can't decide\
    \ to go there and be there and also be here at the same time. You're going to\
    \ have to decide to leave one place to go to another. That's what returning is.\
    \ Returning always involves leaving. And there's also in the early church, then\
    \ there's another way of depicting this whole journey. You know, Shuv or Teshuvah\
    \ takes on, it's a dramatic symbol and a return from an old life. It's this way,\
    \ the New Testament, the early church begins to characterize this idea of turning\
    \ around. It's the word baptism. Baptism. Now the word baptism gets actually clarified\
    \ here. Looks like this. Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into\
    \ Christ Jesus, that's not referring to the dunking of people underwater or a\
    \ wonderful horse trough like we have. It's referring to something else. The word\
    \ baptism, which will get symbolized very much quite literally because the word\
    \ baptism literally means the word to immerse or to place into. When they're talking\
    \ about people being baptized into Jesus, the way this is written here is it's\
    \ saying you have been placed into, you have been fully immersed in the person\
    \ of Christ Jesus as it says right here. Through faith you are fully immersed\
    \ in the person of Jesus. It further gets more extreme. Again, remember we're\
    \ talking about coming home or returning. Don't you know that all of us who are\
    \ baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? That's weird. I understand.\
    \ Let me clarify even further. We were therefore buried with him through baptism\
    \ into death. In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the\
    \ glory of the father, we too may live a new life. Now all that is to say is when\
    \ we through faith in Jesus are put into his own life, we're buried with him just\
    \ like he was buried and then raised to walk in a new life. So here's how I illustrate\
    \ this every time we do baptisms. Some of you will recognize this. Hold out your\
    \ hand just like this. Everybody do it just so you get them. You're going to do\
    \ this. It's going to be really helpful. Now all in faith we're buried with Christ\
    \ in baptism. Remember he died on a cross, buried with Christ in baptism, all\
    \ of our sin and death. By the way, if you're being baptized, it's how long I\
    \ hold you under the water. Deep breath. So at this point right now all buried\
    \ with Christ in baptism raised to walk in a new life. People are buried under\
    \ the water and raised to walk in a new life. That's what you're doing. What is\
    \ happening in baptism is the symbolic representation of being baptized into Jesus.\
    \ You've been baptized into Jesus, buried with Christ in baptism, raised to walk\
    \ in a new life. That's all that that is. By the way, this is our new cult wave.\
    \ If you see each other, we all know you belong. Okay, no, anyway. Leaving and\
    \ burying old things, being raised in a new life in Jesus. The invitation on this\
    \ Father's Day, and you're going to see people get baptized in a minute, the invitation,\
    \ you can do it too if you're like I'm not sure if I should, you know, I haven't\
    \ done this. I'm not sure if I should be baptized. If you're not sure, but you\
    \ have already said yes to Jesus, then you should do it. And you're like, but\
    \ my hair, I'm going out to brunch. It's fine. Everybody, it's cool. Everybody\
    \ will think it's cool. Don't worry about it. We'll even give you a t-shirt. Okay,\
    \ so anyway, now the invitation at Father's Day is two words. And if you could\
    \ get this, it's the message of the prophets. It's the summary of all the instruments\
    \ and the chorus coming together. That same melody played all the way out and\
    \ blown up into huge ways. The huge, the message of the prophets and the message\
    \ to you on Father's Day. In a moment, we'll see the baptism, which will culminate\
    \ in that baptism is this, this two word phrase. Come home. Come home. Come home.\
    \ Some of you needed to hear that. You haven't heard that in a long time. Come\
    \ home. Maybe for some of you, it's the first time you get to come home to Jesus.\
    \ You never really thought about it in those terms. You thought about it like\
    \ I got to get my act together. Man, I got it because then I can come home. And\
    \ the invitation isn't to do that. It's just to simply come home. Just, hey, leave\
    \ that old life and come on. We'll take care of the rest of that stuff. Maybe\
    \ you're tired of wandering around. Come home. Maybe even searching for some answers\
    \ and you keep coming up empty. And we say it all the time around it. We do not\
    \ have all the answers. We just know that we belong into a life with Jesus. And\
    \ so maybe for you, that's a person for you. You're like, I don't know what to\
    \ do. I'm feeling still pretty empty. Come home. Maybe you're trying to make sense\
    \ of a life that you're living and you're trying to figure out how to justify\
    \ it or trying to figure out, trying to convince yourself that it feels amazing,\
    \ that it is great. But you know deep down it's not the life that you want. Trapped\
    \ in relationships, lost in a particular kind of loneliness and calling it success\
    \ or calling it whatever. Come home. Maybe you felt unwanted or unworthy. Every\
    \ one of us in here has cut stuff. Like I said, we've all got secrets that if\
    \ people knew about it they'd be horrified. We've all given ourselves some permission\
    \ at some point. Never too far gone. Come home. Come home. Baptism is a symbol\
    \ of someone who has come home, who has left one place and arrived at another.\
    \ It is the transformation that God has done but is not yet finished in a person.\
    \ It is not magic. It does not make someone a Christian. It is a symbol of what\
    \ God has done. And maybe for some of you the first step isn't, just because you've\
    \ already maybe you haven't come to this first step, but the first step is probably\
    \ just simply saying I want to come home. Maybe you celebrate it with baptism,\
    \ but let's start with coming home. Would you pray with me and then we'll have\
    \ some baptisms and we'll talk about coming home. Jesus, in so many areas of our\
    \ lives we get lost and lonely and we wander and we need you to come get us. So\
    \ we want to leave our old life. It's not as we don't know how. Father forgive\
    \ us that we tried to make sense of things in a way that we did not know what\
    \ we were doing. We screwed it up. Forgive us. We need your forgiveness. We want\
    \ to come home. Maybe for the first time in your life you don't have all the,\
    \ you don't know much about the church or the Bible or anything else, but you've\
    \ got a sense that God might be calling you home to Him. Maybe for the first time\
    \ it's just yes Jesus I want to come home. Father though baptism is something\
    \ that maybe a lot of us have done or maybe we've seen before, might we continually\
    \ live a life that is dying to old things and stepping into new things that you\
    \ call us to by the power of your spirit Jesus. Father we get to celebrate now\
    \ this milestone in people's lives as they're buried with you in baptism and raised\
    \ to walk in a new life. We're grateful that that's the work you do in an ongoing\
    \ basis in our life Jesus. In your name that we pray right now amen. Folks we're\
    \ gonna do some baptisms. This is gonna be pretty cool. If that's something you\
    \ want to do and you're like I didn't plan on it just head over there we'll get\
    \ you all checked in. We'll put you in this super warm water in our glorious horse\
    \ trough okay. Let's get some baptisms going. Will you stand as we celebrate and\
    \ sing together. I've got nothing new how could I express oh my gratitude I could\
    \ sing these songs as I often do Chang's \u015B I've got one response \u015B I've\

    \ a heart singing Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah I love you Lord For your mercy\
    \ never fails me All in my days I've been held in your hand From the moment that\
    \ I wake up Until I lay my head Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God And all\
    \ my life you have been faithful And all my life you have been so, so good With\
    \ every breath that I am able Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God Oh I will\
    \ sing And all my life you have been faithful And all my life you have been so,\
    \ so good With every breath that I am able Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God\
    \ Of the goodness of God Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God Oh I will sing\
    \ Of the goodness of God Applause That's so fun. By the way, if you're a person,\
    \ we don't have time to do anymore. But we have another service. So in 50 minutes\
    \ we can do another one. If you're like, I should have done it. But if I get a\
    \ message from God to get baptized, this is your message from God right now. Okay,\
    \ I just want to tell you, this is it. This is the miraculous moment you're waiting\
    \ for. You can still do it next year. We have one more service to do this. So,\
    \ but we do have to make some room for the 1130 service. So here's what I want\
    \ you to do. Would you hold out your hands? Would you receive this as a blessing?\
    \ If you're not comfortable with this, that's okay. However you want to hold your\
    \ hands, that's all right. Would you receive these words as a blessing to you?\
    \ From the prophet Isaiah who writes these words. I made you and you are my servant.\
    \ I will not forget you. I've swept away your offenses like a cloud and your sins\
    \ like the morning mist. Return to me for I have redeemed you. Sing for joy you\
    \ heavens for the Lord has done this. Shout aloud you earth beneath. Burst into\
    \ song you mountains, your forests and all your trees for the Lord has redeemed.\
    \ He displays his glory. Wherever it is that you might wander, find yourself being\
    \ wayward, lost, lonely, overwhelmed. If you ever wonder to yourself, I've gone\
    \ too far. There is no too far that God's love cannot reach. He calls you home\
    \ to him. Whatever it is that you encounter, may the love of the Father and the\
    \ grace of the Son and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit be among\
    \ you all in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you guys. If you have needs for prayer,\
    \ we'd love to pray with you. Come back next service. We got more baptisms to\
    \ do. God bless you."

  title: Momentum and Our Spiritual Direction
  transcript: ' All right, good morning church. Good morning. Beated with you. Good
    to be with you. How you feeling good? Good get some energy in here. I love it.
    My name is Rob Fernandez I''ve privilege of being one of the pastors here specifically
    over outreach I also am on the teaching team but an honor to be with you those
    that are outside Grateful you could join us that way those that are online glad
    that you''re there, too But just know that there''s always room for you in person
    the people that are in the room This I believe is the beautiful picture of what
    it looks like to be together and worship together This is the picture of the church.
    So I''m honored to be with you I am getting to kind of close up our series somebody
    save me But before we jump into it, I did want to give you an update because a
    lot of you''ve been asking about What''s happening with the hurricane, you know?
    Haley and Milton that kind of there''s all the people that are impacted so grateful
    because of your generosity Our church has already been able to be a part of the
    work that''s being done on the ground there in six different states Distribution
    centers, thank you. Thank you. Thank you You are impacting the lives of people
    that are hurting right now And so we''re gonna as a church continue to pray but
    know that your generosity towards outreach God is using that because we''ve been
    able to partner with people that are on the ground already Wanted you to know
    that before we jumped in. All right So we''re in this series somebody saved me
    now I''m gonna tell you I haven''t always been someone that has followed Jesus
    my whole life That''ll be a part of my story that I share But when I was not following
    Jesus and I would hear kind of the idea of like to be saved or salvation It was
    kind of a foreign word for me, but I also had a very narrow understanding of what
    it meant to be saved I understood it in my narrow understanding as like some kind
    of protection from a punishment that would happen later But they''re like there
    something was gonna happen and and salvation would save you from that punishment
    later in life or even after this life Okay, that was my narrow view but it is
    so much more than that as I''ve learned Jesus says this in Luke 19 He says for
    the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost now we could read that and to
    see the word Save and say okay my my narrow Understanding is still relevant But
    the reality is as we look at that word to save it is so much more robust than
    we can understand Now that word to save is this Greek word sozo which actually
    means more than just this idea saving There''s this rescue and healing and preservation
    part of what it means to be saved So when Jesus says I came to seek and save the
    lost he''s talking about this really robust understanding of saving healing preserving
    and rescuing now I''d mentioned for me as a young adult salvation or being saved
    wasn''t very compelling to me because of my narrow Understanding I just thought
    well if it''s something about that''s gonna get dealt with later I''ll deal with
    it later because I don''t have to worry about it until that time comes and I would
    then choose to live my life taking steps towards things of this world because
    I thought well That''s for later if this whole God thing is real Deal with it
    later And what I did was in not really understanding what I was doing every step
    that I took towards the world the part of creation That''s separated from God
    my own selfish desires. I Started to build a momentum in my life. I started to
    build a momentum actually towards it was carrying me towards my own Destruction
    and here''s the thing when momentum builds by the time we realize where it''s
    carrying us Sometimes it can feel like it''s too late. I''m gonna share a story
    You''re welcome to laugh at this picture myself. I actually had like the group
    photo and then the individual I decided to not show the individual photo because
    I didn''t want you to judge me for my frosted tips in the early 2000s, but this
    is me football I was I''m right here number 21. I just don''t I''m not like sharing
    the glory days I was not a great athlete. I was a very average athlete. I was
    not the best that wasn''t the worst But I definitely wasn''t the best the reason
    I share this is because after this picture was taken the next season You start
    practice and when you start practice you don''t play with the helmet and pads
    You''re like kind of get back into like the agility of it all and your cardio
    and all those things the drills and so one summer Day, I''m at practice and I
    wasn''t very good But I tried to give it my all and I remember I played defense
    and so one of the drills that we would run Is that you would backpedal the coach
    would be in front of you He would throw the ball and your job is to get to the
    ball Intercept the ball turn your hips and run full speed to intercept the ball.
    So here I am. I''m backpedaling all focus I see the ball thrown. I''m running
    full speed what I didn''t realize is that the coach had overthrown the ball and
    it and I were heading directly into the corner of a brick building that was at
    the edge of the football Now what I was told is that I hit that corner of the
    brick wall full speed face first what I remember is Waking up opening my eyes
    feeling like I was waking up for the day It was such a strange feeling but I''ve
    opened my eyes all of my teammates and friends are around me saying like are you
    okay? They said that my body had ricocheted like eight feet and then just laid
    flat on the on the field Now I woke up and I had Broken my teeth in my mouth of
    the front my teeth were just destroyed I had two black eyes I had a busted collarbone
    and I had a bruise from like my forehead a Perfect line of a bruise from the corner
    of the wall down my torso now. I Remember, you know because I had broken my teeth
    my I actually didn''t like they didn''t get knocked out I cut they were cut in
    half. I''m so sorry to share that detail, but I had the choice I remember I had
    the choice the dentist like you could go with the gold tooth or Like the regular
    porcelain porcelain one and I think about like where would my life have gone and
    I chosen the gold tooth in the front but You know I had there was a dance coming
    up after that and to get all the dental surgery it took a while And so my dentist
    actually like glued my half tooth back on and I remember the week of the dance
    I bit into something hard and it and it popped out again And so I''m an insecure
    high schooler who now looks like a Hispanic hillbilly and I''m like, what do I
    do with myself? But I share that story because the point of it is that my momentum
    The steps that I had taken had carried me to a place of my own destruction And
    in an existence of which I was broken which I did not want My momentum had carried
    me to a place that Resulted with me being in a broken state, and I did not want
    that now the reality is We are multifaceted beings. We are our physical selves.
    That is true God has created us to have this physical body But we are also more
    than that there is a part of us a facet of who we are in which every single one
    of us Shares the part of us in which God has breathed into us our soul So we are
    spiritual beings as much as we are physical beings and The truth of our momentum
    is true for both of those things In the same way that our bodies can physically
    carry me towards a brick wall the choices and the steps that we take and the Decisions
    that we make have the power to build a momentum in our spiritual lives that potentially
    are Taking us and carrying us to a place that we actually don''t want to go maybe
    are even our own destruction and we could feel Like by the time we realize where
    it''s carrying us that it''s too late So we have to ask this question knowing
    that we are Multifaceted knowing that we are physical and spiritual beings we
    have to ask this question. Where is my momentum taking me? Where is my momentum
    taking me? You know sometimes we then after we ask this question like and do I
    have it in me to change direction? But where is my momentum taking me is there
    a part of your life that you are not convinced that you have it in you To change
    direction maybe there. It''s a part of your life that you''ve hidden from others
    Maybe it''s a part of your life that feels like a small thing But you''re realizing
    well I''ve taken a lot of steps towards this thing that I''ve tried to hide and
    it is carrying me to a place that I do Not want to go Maybe it''s visible by other
    people or you''ve done a good job hiding it we all wrestle with things That could
    build an unhealthy momentum in our lives if they aren''t addressed And it leads
    us to a story of a man named Paul now Paul was a very influential person in the
    church Especially in the early church But he didn''t start following Jesus until
    after the crucifixion of Jesus after the resurrection from the grave and after
    Jesus has sent it Back into heaven after all of that takes place is when Paul
    begins to follow Jesus But his story many of you might know is messy. It is not
    a pretty story Paul''s story even though he was so influential is very ugly at
    the start He wasn''t a Jesus follower at first and it actually indicated that
    he probably had a level of hatred towards Christians and Jesus himself I mean
    just look at what scripture says in Acts 9. This is about Paul Meanwhile Saul
    was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord''s disciples I mean,
    this is a picture of I mean to breathe out murderous threats Imagine the darkness
    the whole the momentum that this individual might be feeling to be breathing out
    murderous threats against the Lord''s disciples Continues it says that he went
    to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus another
    city So that if he found any there who belonged to the way, this is what they
    called people that followed Jesus the way Whether men or women he might take them
    as prisoners to Jerusalem No, he was a zealous man. It says and zeal is essentially
    like passion and action together It''s not just like passion for the sake of passion
    But these two things working together and it said that he was zealous now zeal
    could be Unhealthily directed it could have this level of like it''s carrying
    you to a bad place and in this case it was for him now You probably also thinking
    I keep saying his name is Paul, but I''m seeing Saul It is not a typo Paul had
    actually two interchangeable names and many people think like oh He was this way
    and then God changed him and he changed his name That''s Simon that was changing
    to Peter Saul and Paul are both of his names Let me tell you why one was his Hebrew
    name So he Saul was his Hebrew name known by his Jewish community But uniquely
    to Paul he was a citizen of the Roman Empire very Jews were not typically citizens
    of the Roman Empire They were subjects subjects of the Empire not citizens for
    one reason or another Somehow Paul was given citizenship which was hard to get
    and so his Roman Empire name his his Latin name was Paulus or Paul And both of
    those were true and depending on his audience if he was talking to Jews He would
    go by by Saul if he was kind of Engaging with Gentiles and which are like non-jewish
    people us would be would be a Gentile. He would go by Paul So let''s talk about
    momentum though. Let''s talk about Paul''s spiritual life momentum Here''s what
    we know to be true. He is breathing out murderous threats against God''s people
    Earlier in in the book of Acts we see that this man named Stephen a Christian
    had gone to the Jewish leadership and told them Hey listen I mean this beautiful
    explanation of who Jesus is and he says essentially when you rejected Jesus you
    rejected God and they dragged him out into the gates of Jerusalem and they stoned
    him to death and In that moment Paul is there Standing as people are laying their
    coats for Paul to watch them and it says that he watched the coats as they stoned
    Stephen to Death and then later on it says and he approved of the killing again
    What kind of thing is happening in Paul? What kind of like dark momentum had been
    built in his life to he got to the point where he''s a witness of murder He''s
    he''s breathing out murder sets. I mean that is some serious momentum And so we
    actually see this in in Acts 8 But Saul began to destroy the church going from
    house to house He dragged both men and women and put them in prison I mean really
    picture that Imagine this group of people that belonged to the way they maybe
    they''d broken bread together and they were celebrating they get back home and
    they''re there with their kids and this group of of Passionate and what they''ve
    heard is murderous people kicks the door open Drags the mom drags the dad is in
    front of their kids to prison as there I mean it says drag them they didn''t like
    willingly go it was a violent scene and this is what this man Paul was a part
    of an absolute enemy of the church and of God and in the midst of heading down
    a Direction that was going to lead to his own destruction and potentially the
    destruction of the church something miraculous happens God chooses to intervene
    in a really incredible way Even though he was kind of in this place where I''m
    like, I don''t know how you come back from that And so I ask you, you know, we''re
    talking about momentum even of our spiritual lives Where is a place for you? That
    you have maybe been building this unhealthy momentum towards a thing that you''ve
    either tried to hide or people know about and You''re you''re holding on to this
    and you''re like shoot I have I''ve been making these choices that is directing
    my spiritual life in a really harmful way And I don''t know if I have it in me
    to change direction. Where is that for you? Hold on to where that is because what
    we''re gonna get to see through Paul''s life and what God does Is that we are
    never too far down a path no matter how powerful our momentum may be so with Paul
    God does something miraculous Remember Paul earlier had asked the kind of the
    high priest. Give me some letters I''m gonna go to these other cities and I''m
    gonna find more Christians and I''m gonna persecute them I''m gonna put them in
    prison and it seems like he got that letter So he''s on his way to the city called
    Damascus and on his way Says that this heavenly light flashed around him kind
    of dropped him to his knees and and in that moment He has an experience with Jesus
    This is the after crucifixion after resurrection after heavenly ascendant like
    this is Jesus after all of those things meets Paul on This road to Damascus and
    and it''s it''s a powerful thing. And so we see what happens Next is that he''s
    blinded He it says that he can''t he doesn''t eat or drink for three days He''s
    led by his hand into Damascus and this is there But while all of that''s happening
    God is doing something else in this in this person named Ananias Ananias was a
    Christian in Damascus in the city in which now Paul is at and God told Ananias
    Hey, I have this man. I want you to go pray for him and Ananias kind of wrestles
    with guys I''ve heard about this guy. He''s a murderous type person. I don''t
    is that and God''s like no I want you to see what I''m gonna do through the life
    of this person whose Momentum was absolutely carrying him towards the destruction
    of himself in the church I want the world to see what I can do through this man''s
    life And so we see in Acts 9 17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it
    placing his hand on Saul. He said brother Saul the Lord Jesus who appeared to
    you on the road as you were coming here has sent me so that you may see again
    and be filled With the Holy Spirit I read this and there''s you know that part
    Jesus who appeared to you What a beautiful picture of the grip the how graceful
    and and gracious to God the goddess Oscar I''m gonna get that sentence out It
    is a beautiful picture of Who God is his quality and characteristic You see we
    often think okay. I need to get my life, right? I need that thing that has been
    carrying momentum I need to figure it out first and then I can approach God and
    yet what we see is Jesus appears to him in the midst of all of this momentum that
    Paul had all of this darkness that Paul had God Meets him there in the same way
    that no matter how hard our momentum has carried us towards that brick wall of
    destruction In our life God is willing to meet us in that mess We don''t have
    to figure out how to shift our momentum first God meets us there and what Jesus
    says to Paul He''s like why do you persecute me and it''s another beautiful picture
    Paul had been persecuting the church That''s the closeness that God feels to his
    people that if the persecution is against them. It''s to him That''s the kind
    of proximity that Jesus feels I would argue absolutely not Paul did not have it
    in himself to change direction until this moment in time He didn''t have it in
    him So what happened then how did a murderous prideful Spiritually blind person
    become a pillar of God''s church someone who was known for their humility He called
    himself the least of the Apostles at one point Someone who was known for their
    humility he called himself the least of the Apostles at one point I mean this
    is a person who then invested their their entire life Into other people and raising
    up the church talking about the love of God through Jesus How does that kind of
    change happen and we ask that because all of us and I love that we say this as
    a church We are a work in progress people. We don''t just say it we experience
    it So we all have these things that are still broken that we''re still kind of
    working out What do we do with that we ask the question how does that kind of
    change happen because we want to experience that power in our lives as well No
    matter how committed to a path that maybe your momentum has carried you God offers
    something different and he wants us to experience that power to shift our momentum
    He wants us to have it Last week Jeff McGuire had he taught a great our senior
    pastor taught a great message and at the end there was an invitation an invitation
    to to make this kind of public declaration that that for the first time you wanted
    to follow Jesus And it was these words to stand up and say I believe so many people
    stood up and said I believe it was awesome It was powerful essentially people
    saying I not only do I believe that Jesus is who he says he is But I am placing
    my trust in this person Jesus I''m going to learn what it means to follow him
    but when we say I believe maybe like me when I kind of beginning to follow Jesus
    I would say okay I believe now what did I make it have I arrived is my my ticket
    punched for heaven is that all I have to worry about The reality is asking the
    question now what is a great question a question that we should all be asking
    pretty regularly God now what with an open hand posture like what is it that you
    want to do what do you have for me is a great question for us to ask And the reality
    is when it comes to salvation or being saved it is so much more than just the
    destination we eventually experience It is so much more robust there''s so much
    more for us to experience now it is not just the destination It really is this
    lifelong process in which we go to God every single day and let me tell you sometimes
    it''s painful Sometimes it could hurt to go to God and say I am clay in your hands
    will you shape me will you mold me will you change me Will you help me be more
    loving will you help me be more surrendered will you help me be more joy filled
    more secure more sacrificial Will you help me be more authentically connected
    to other people will you help me be more of who you are God and as you shape me
    Will you help me be less anxious less selfish less prideful less angry less of
    who I was and more of who you intend me to be That is a picture of what salvation
    looks like every single day of our lives and it is a process but we ask the question
    Do I have it in me to make that kind of daily consistent change and what was true
    for Paul is true for us on our own absolutely not I''ve tried it I''ve done some
    self help stuff before following Jesus and it got me about this far but not where
    I actually was intended to go by God It''s so much more do I have it in me not
    on our own but what''s true for Paul is true for us remember Ananias went to him
    and he said Brother Saul the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road as you
    were coming here has sent me so that you may see again and what be filled with
    the Holy Spirit You want to talk about the power that has the ability to shift
    our momentum from our destruction towards the life that God intends that is filled
    with all joy and peace There is a power and that power is the Holy Spirit that''s
    what Paul experienced on that day that Ananias prayed for him And it''s such a
    beautiful picture of what God gives us you see God gave of himself twice to us
    through Jesus on the cross God gave his son who died on the cross willingly Rose
    again from the dead defeating death forever paying the price of our sin but eventually
    Jesus would say I''m going I got to go I''m going to sit at the right hand of
    the Father I''m going to sit at the right hand of the Father and I''m going to
    sit at the right hand of the Father and I''m going to sit at the right hand of
    the Father and I''m going to sit at the right hand of the Father and I''m going
    to sit at the right hand of the Father and I''m going to sit at the right hand

    to sit at the right hand of the Father and I''m going to sit at the right hand
    of the Father and I''m going to sit at the right hand of the Father and remember
    I''d mentioned that the Spirit decides that He wants to dwell in us and every
    person that follows Jesus becomes a place in which the Spirit dwells. Before the
    Spirit of God was confined, not really, but man made hands made the Holy of Holies
    in the temple and God''s Spirit was there. When Jesus was crucified, the veil
    that separated that place in the temple, it was torn. It was a picture of God
    saying, Listen, I can''t be confined into a space. I am choosing to dwell now
    in the lives and in the hearts of my people. That is where my Spirit will now
    live. And so you have Paul writing to Timothy saying, Look, this is a gift. We
    don''t have to earn it. It is something that is given. And it gives us these things,
    power, love, and self-discipline. The Spirit of God is not for pastors on a stage.
    It''s not for people who lead worship. It is not for a small select few, a group
    of people that follow Jesus. The Spirit of God is for every single one of us.
    Every single one of us. If you believe in the person of Jesus, you have now become
    a place in which the Spirit of God dwells. That is what God has chosen. And it
    says it gives us power, love, and self-discipline. Power for what? Power to be
    transformed into the person that God intends every single day. Power to live in
    the purpose in which God has given every single one of us. All of us have a purpose,
    whether we realize it or not. That our purpose on this earth and actually for
    eternity is to live in the presence of God that was made available because of
    Jesus, and then to invite others into that same presence. We all share that purpose.
    And it''s going to look so different depending on the life that we live and the
    places that we work. But all of us share that purpose. So there''s power. And
    then there''s love. Love that helps direct ourselves away from ourselves. To look
    to other people and say, how can I care for you? To look towards the stranger
    who''s hurting and have the same compassion that God has. That''s what the Spirit
    gives us. Even the people that we consider enemies. The power of the Spirit in
    us says, I will learn to love those that I have called enemies. And potentially
    I can learn they''re not actually enemies at all, but they are image bearers of
    God. That is one thing that we get to learn our entire lives. And it''s hard.
    Part of that love also helps us let go of the bitterness and unforgiveness we
    carry. That Spirit that God has given us lets us let go of bitterness and unforgiveness
    because of love. Gosh, maybe you''re here. Maybe you are here and you''ve said
    these words to yourself. I just hate myself. I''m so sorry. That is heartbreaking.
    Because that is not what God intends for you at all. Maybe you screwed up, you
    messed up, you did a thing and you''re sitting in the shame. You''re like, I just
    hate myself. That is not what God wants for you. His Spirit in you will tell you
    different. His Spirit in you will point you back to his son Jesus who died on
    a cross for you. He has made us worthy of love. God says you are of infinite value
    to me. That''s what the Spirit of love does in us. And then self-discipline. The
    ability to say no to the part of us that wants to carry us, our momentum towards
    our own destruction. That''s what self-discipline is. The ability to say no to
    the part of us that wants to carry us towards that brick wall will absolutely
    destroy us. And God says, I''ll give you that power, that love and that self-discipline.
    And you might be thinking, okay Rob, if I have the Spirit of God in me, I''ve
    said yes to Jesus. And if you haven''t yet and you''re here, so glad that you''re
    here. God is, he is present with you and directing you. I hope you know that.
    You are absolutely welcome in this place. But if you are a person who''s like,
    I''m a Christian, I believe in Jesus. Why do I still mess up if the Spirit of
    God is in me? Why do I still fail if the Spirit of God is in me? I''m going to
    share a story that kind of spans my whole life. I''ve dealt with anger and like
    rage in my life. Like really was kind of a large quality of who I was, especially
    as a kid and as a young adult. About 12 years old, I was on the receiving end
    of somebody''s disproportionate anger. And from that point in my life at 12 years
    old until about 24, anger is what directed my life. I didn''t really quite understand
    how destructive it was, but it was what kind of led my life until I was about
    24. I felt like God was calling me back into his presence. And I remember I got
    into like a scuffle with somebody and I got home and I was raging. I was like,
    I''m going to go get retribution. I wanted revenge and it was all consuming, all
    consuming. But I was following Jesus and what I didn''t quite understand is the
    Holy Spirit was dwelling in me. And I remember feeling like God was saying, Rob,
    this is not what I want for you. In that moment of my rage at one in the morning,
    it was like, God was like, I do not want this for you. And so I remember I went,
    I let go of my plan for revenge and retribution. I went to my bed and I sat there
    with my fist clenched and I said, God, if this is not from you, then take it away.
    Take it away in tears in my eyes. I woke up the next morning, a changed man. It
    is nothing short of a miracle of what God did in my life. My girlfriend, who is
    now my wife at the time. Well, she''s my wife now, but it was my girlfriend at
    the time. Thank you. She''ll attest to it. She''s like, Rob, from that point in
    your life, everything was different. And I can only give credit to God for really
    healing me from something that was deeply rooted. Now, this is now the admission
    of my own continued process. About a month ago, I had just all of these things
    being built up in me. Frustration, life, I was doing my taxes. I''m like, it''s
    almost October and I''m doing, I was just stressed out. And something happened
    in my life where it just started to build. I felt the momentum, something that
    I hadn''t experienced in 15 years, start to build in me. And my wife asked me,
    and we''re in the kitchen and my daughter''s kind of in the other room there.
    And she''s like, hey, are you OK? Because she could see something was up. And
    as I began to explain all of the things, I felt it rise. I felt it rise and I
    felt it rise to the point that I''m like, I''m about to have a meltdown right
    now. And so in that moment, wanting to guard my family from my own expression
    of rage and anger that was building up inside me, I storm out of the room with
    all of my frustration. I''m like beelining it for the garage because I have a
    weight set in there. I''m like, I just need something to like express this rage
    that I''m feeling. I kick the garage door open. I mean, I''m telling you, I''m
    having a total meltdown, but trying to isolate myself from my family. And I remember
    my daughter''s tricycle was in the way. I like I hooked that thing. I keep walking
    it two more steps. There''s boxes that I just placed there, like all organized.
    I hooked those things and I get I put more weight than I could carry. I sit there
    and I have this moment of rage. And after it''s all done, you know what I realized?
    I''m not OK. This didn''t solve it. I was still sitting in that rage. Here''s
    the here''s the worst part for me. I hear my daughter who hears the commotion
    in the garage. Ask my wife, what''s happening? In that moment, I felt all of the
    shame and all of the guilt of my own brokenness in that moment of giving into
    where my momentum was letting me go. And I got the keys because I still was feeling
    that. And I left and I found myself in a parking lot just kind of sitting and
    wrestling with God. I was sitting and wrestling with God because here''s what
    I asked God. Didn''t you heal me? Wasn''t this thing that I dealt with? Isn''t
    that? Didn''t you heal me? What happened? Have I been believing a lie? And God''s
    Holy Spirit, which is so merciful and gracious, in that moment as I sat in my
    car, he says, Rob, I have saved you and I am saving you. I have healed you and
    I am healing you. And I was overwhelmed in that moment of just by God''s mercy
    and grace because I was telling myself, you failure of a dad, you you are such
    a fraud. You can never share this story, hide this. And then God''s Spirit steps
    in and says, Rob, I have healed you and I am healing you. Both of those things
    are true. And it let me let go of the lies. It let me hold on to truth. And maybe
    you are here and there is something in your life, a momentum in which you have
    been carrying that has been directing you towards destruction. And you need to
    hear from God. I have saved you and I am saving you. I have healed you and I am
    healing you. You see, what that allows us to understand is when we do have a failure
    in our life, even with the Spirit of God in us, it is not the end. It is the opportunity
    for the Spirit to direct us again, to heal us again. I went home after that and
    I felt convicted by the Holy Spirit. He was like, go apologize. Go apologize.
    Yeah, you isolated yourself in the garage, but you need to go apologize. So I
    went to my wife and I am like, I am so sorry that this kind of out thing, whatever
    I did, happened. And she is like, Rob, she is so gracious. She is like, I know
    you have a lot on your plate. And then I go to my daughter. And I sit her down
    and I am like, hey, dad got really frustrated and really upset. And I did not
    count to four the way that I have taught you to. And she is so sweet. She is like,
    that is okay, dad. You know, she runs off and plays. I didn''t count to four.
    I am a work in progress. We are a work in progress, but we aren''t alone in the
    progress. And God gives us his Holy Spirit. Paul would say this, for the message
    of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being
    saved, the process of salvation, the process of rescue, the process of healing,
    it is the power of God. There was a point in my life where the cross was foolish
    to me. I didn''t get it until God met me in my mess and said, I can redirect your
    whole life if you let me. And the more I surrender to God, the more I experience
    the power of God. And I am telling you, the more you surrender and say, God, there
    are these things, I am not going to hide anymore. I am not going to hide them
    from you. I am not going to hide them from other people. I want you to address
    them. Will you shift my momentum? Will you change my direction? No matter how
    far down a path you have gone, Jesus will meet you there. He does not need you
    to figure your life out. First, he will meet you in the mess. And then you will
    begin to have this power in you, the spirit that will direct your life. And you
    know what? Later on, even if you follow Jesus, when you mess up, God''s spirit
    will be there again to say, I have saved you and I will continue to do so. Let
    me work in you. That is power that is available to us. Where is your momentum
    taking you? Maybe the better question is, have you allowed God to be a part of
    that process with you? Because I am telling you, you will be met with mercy and
    grace and your life will be transformed by the indwelling of his spirit in you.
    Let''s pray together. Lord God, we are so grateful. We are grateful for the way
    that you love us and care for us, the fact that you meet us in our mess. Your
    spirit is gracious, Lord. God, I pray for the person here that maybe they believe
    the lie, that they are too far gone, that their momentum has taken them too far.
    God, you are the one who saves, who rescues, who heals. Lord, I pray that your
    Holy Spirit would continue to dwell in us and that you would give us an awareness
    of how you were moving, that we might run to you, our Father, and be met with
    love and mercy. Thank you, God, for caring for us in that way. God, we are done
    with the hiding. We run to you. Would you meet us? Would you guide us? Would you
    direct us? It''s in Jesus'' name we pray. Amen.'
