    \ the bound You see about to move As I walk through the shadow, your love surrounds\
    \ me. Yeah. There's nothing to fear now, for I am safe with you. So when I'm high,\
    \ I'll ride on my knees, with my head lifted high. Oh, God, the battle belongs\
    \ to you. And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night. Oh,\
    \ God, the battle belongs to you. And if you were for me, who could be against\
    \ me? For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for you. When all I see are the ashes,\
    \ you see the beauty. Yes, you do. When all I see is a cross, God, you see the\
    \ empty door. Oh, so I'll sing through the night. So when I'm high, I'll ride\
    \ on my knees, with my head lifted high. Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. And\
    \ every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night. Oh, God, the battle\
    \ belongs to you. And, oh, mighty fortress, you go before us. Nothing can stand\
    \ against the power of our God. You shine in the shadow. You win every battle.\
    \ Nothing can stand against the power of our God. Oh, almighty fortress, you go\

    \ Oh, almighty fortress, you go before us. Nothing can stand against the power\
    \ of our God. You shine in the shadow. You win every battle. Nothing can stand\
    \ against the power of our God. So when I'm high, I'll ride on my knees, with\
    \ my head lifted high. Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. Oh, God, the battle\
    \ belongs to you. And every fear I lay at your feet, I'll sing through the night.\
    \ Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. Oh, God, the battle belongs to you. Oh,\
    \ you are holy, yes. Oh, we bring you peace. A thousand generations falling down\
    \ in worship. Oh, you are holy, yes. Oh, we bring you peace. Oh, you are holy,\
    \ yes. Oh, we bring you peace. Falling down in worship. Sing the song of ages\
    \ through the night. It's all gone before us. It's all we'll believe. We'll sing\
    \ the song of ages through the night. Your name, your name is the highest. Your\
    \ name is the greatest. Your name, Santa, both and all. All grows into millions.\
    \ All powers and positions. Your name, Santa, both and all. And the angels cry,\
    \ Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy, holy forever. And\
    \ if you've been forgiven, And if you've buried tears, Sing the song forever through\
    \ the night. And if you walk in freedom, And if you bear His name, Sing the song\
    \ forever through the night. Sing the song forever as He did, And the angels cry,\
    \ Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy, holy forever. Holy,\
    \ holy forever. Hear people sing, Holy, to the King of Kings. Holy, you will always\
    \ be. Holy, holy forever. Your name, your name is the highest. Your name is the\
    \ greatest. Your name, Santa, both and all. All grows into millions. All powers\
    \ and positions. Your name, Santa, both and all. Your name is the highest. Your\
    \ name is the greatest. Your name stands above them all. All grows into millions.\
    \ All powers and positions. Your name stands above them all. And the angels cry,\
    \ And the angels cry, Holy, our creation cries. Holy, you are lifted high. Holy,\
    \ holy forever. Hear your people sing, Hear your people sing, Holy, to the King\
    \ of Kings. Holy, you will always be. Holy, holy forever. Holy, holy forever.\
    \ You will always be. Holy, holy forever. You are holy, yes. So holy. Amen. Well,\
    \ we can sing that song with confidence. Knowing that God is holy, holy forever,\
    \ that His name will last forever, that He is set apart. The description in the\
    \ book of Revelation is that the angels bow down and worship Him and they say,\
    \ holy, holy, holy. Yet He's a God that cares about us. That's involved in our\
    \ lives, that knows the individual aspects of what we're going through and wants\
    \ to help us grow and transform us into the person that He wants us to be. We\
    \ got to celebrate this last night as we had our rooted graduates here as they\
    \ ended their 10-week experience and celebrated them. And we saw the transformation.\
    \ We heard stories and story after story of people that said, I signed up for\
    \ this and I was hoping for this. And God did this. The individual transformation\
    \ that takes place in each life is because of a God that is holy. It's also because\
    \ of a people that have said, we're going to be generous in our response to what\
    \ God is doing and we're going to jump in in any way that we feel led. And it's\
    \ your generosity and your worship and your offering that you have brought that\
    \ allows things like Rooted to take place. And for those of you that are in life\
    \ groups, you know that Rooted is the first 10 weeks of a life group and you get\
    \ connected to your church and the people around you and God and learn more about\
    \ yourself. We get to see that transformation take place because of the generosity\
    \ here at Harbor Point. And if you want to jump in and participate in that, there's\
    \ ways on the screens behind me that you can jump in and play a part in that generosity.\
    \ But I want you to see in just a minute on the screens behind me you're going\
    \ to watch Cardboard Testimonies. And if you know about Rooted, Cardboard Testimony\
    \ is a chance to kind of look back on where we were 10 weeks ago, what we were\
    \ as that person and what we were experiencing going through and how we've been\
    \ transformed and changed by God, a holy God that cares about us today. So you're\
    \ going to see that in the next song in just a little bit. Would you pray with\
    \ me as we continue in our service? Father, we thank you. We thank you, God, that\
    \ you are holy. We sing, we raise our hands, we proclaim that truth through song\
    \ today knowing that you are holy and you care about us. You want to transform\
    \ our lives because you have a picture of who we can be. And Lord, you're engaged\
    \ and in our lives. And we praise you for that. Father, we respond in our offering\
    \ now as a worship to you. And God, we give it to you because we know that you\
    \ can take it and use it to continue to transform more and more lives. We thank\
    \ you for who you are. We ask that you be with us now and shape us and form us\
    \ as we continue in our service and worship today. It's in your son's name we\
    \ pray. Amen. I'm going to sing a little bit of the Lord's Prayer. I'm going to\

    \ together. Welcome to Harbor Point. There are so many dads throughout the room.\
    \ Happy Father's Day to you all. Beautiful people all throughout the room. Why\
    \ don't you turn to your neighbor, give somebody a high five. You can grab a seat.\
    \ Oh, wow, you're taking this serious. I'm serious. The whole thing is about being\
    \ serious. Apparently you're not ready to be serious. That may lower this so you\
    \ can hear my joke appropriately. I can hear it. Okay. All right, I've got to\
    \ put mine down a little bit. Is that your first joke? That was it. I don't get\
    \ it. Okay. I've got to get in the zone. Like I said, I'm not at a disadvantage,\
    \ I laugh at my own jokes, but I'm competitive, so the two things are going head\
    \ to head here. Give me your worst. Look at me. I'm right here. I am right here\
    \ and you're right here and we're crossing our eyes. We're crossing our eyes.\
    \ Elevating the humor level to the next. When I cross my eyes so I can't remember\
    \ my joke. Okay, I remember now. After you read it, you remembered it. Did I get\
    \ a point there? Yeah. What did one eye say to the other eye? You got it. Did\
    \ I get a point there? Yeah. What did one eye say to the other eye? I don't know.\
    \ There's something between us that smells. Does a quiver count? He's quivering.\
    \ You're quivering. Oh, that's a laugh? Yeah. Already? It's a wash. Let's see\
    \ here. I'm reading a horror story in Braille. Something bad is going to happen.\
    \ I can feel it. Thank you. Awesome. Thank you for moving that. Now I can see\
    \ your face. What do you call a paper airplane? I can't fly. I do not know. Ready?\
    \ Stationary. Did you have a bad morning? What's going on? What's going on? The\
    \ morning would be great if I heard some humor around here, but apparently that's\
    \ not what we're doing. I went to buy some camouflage pants either day. Okay.\
    \ I couldn't find any. How? You're terrible. Stop throwing stuff at me. I asked\
    \ the librarian if the library had any books on paranoia. She leaned in and whispered,\
    \ They're right behind you. That's two points for you that I lost on my own joke.\
    \ Yeah. This is easy. At this point, we're doing it. You can't resist this right\
    \ here. If you feel like someone is watching you, you're not alone. You're not\
    \ alone. Dude, that was totally for you. What did Mario say to Princess Peach\
    \ when he dumped her? Mario. It's not you. It's a me, Mario. No, come on. I love\
    \ you so many more. What's the difference between curtains and toilet paper? I\
    \ don't know. So it was you. That's it. I'm happy to go out on that one. Thank\
    \ you. Alright. Yeah. Top shelf humor for you guys that are new with us every\
    \ week. We do that kind of stuff. We just set the bar. I know it's incredible.\
    \ Great to be with you guys. Happy Father's Day. It is Father's Day in case you\
    \ didn't know. Happy Father's Day. I don't want to compare days for parents here.\
    \ If we did that on Mother's Day, it would have been like a wave. I just want\
    \ to say one more time. Happy Father's Day. Yeah, right. Exactly. This is my 20th\
    \ Father's Day, which is really bizarre to think about. You're just like, wow,\
    \ I didn't know he was that old. Now you know. But yeah, my 20th Father's Day.\
    \ In all seriousness, I just want to tell you, and this is really, really crucial.\
    \ You guys, dads matter. The church and the world needs fathers and grandfathers.\
    \ It needs fathers and father figures. So it matters. If you're wondering if you're\
    \ doing a great job, you'll probably never know if you're doing a great job. But\
    \ let me just say if you're showing up, that's half of it. The rest of it you\
    \ can figure out. Just showing up is half of it. And so I'm grateful for you guys.\
    \ Keep being dads and grandfathers and father figures to so many people. We need\
    \ you guys. All right? Cool. Good? Yeah. All right. If you're new with us, my\
    \ name is Jeff. I'm one of the pastors here. I want to tell you, if you're new,\
    \ again, I know there's a lot of places you could be. There's like brunch plans\
    \ you had. There was all kinds of stuff you were planning on doing today. I was\
    \ in church and it was like, I gotta go, I guess. Or something like that. Or maybe\
    \ you were coerced or tricked or however bribed you wound up here. I want to let\
    \ you know that my favorite thing about our church is the people you're sitting\
    \ around. There's a lot of great stuff that happens on this stage, but the best\
    \ stuff that happens in our church is always with the people that you're sitting\
    \ around. And people will tell me over and over again their favorite thing is\
    \ the people they met. They'll say, I'm like, did you not? There's something else\
    \ going on on the stage here. Yeah, yeah, that was fine. But the people I met,\
    \ they were great. They just seemed like a place where I could come and show up\
    \ and kind of be myself and all that sort of stuff. And I'm like, I'm going to\
    \ go. I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm\
    \ like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going to go. And I'm like, I'm going\
    \ to go. Don't let that be a reason why you can't be generous somewhere else.\
    \ And to the degree that it's sacrificially, joyfully generous somewhere else.\
    \ Find somewhere else that's making an eternal difference in the world. And give\
    \ sacrificially to it. Because there are some things that God can only do when\
    \ we're with our generosity, with our sacrificial generosity. You want to join\
    \ the generosity journey here? Great. If you don't, don't let that be a reason\
    \ to not be generous. Period. Find a way to be generous. Everybody cool? Does\
    \ that make sense? All right. We on board with that? Okay, cool. Yeah. We're a\
    \ little more tepid on that. Not quite as excited about that. Okay, that's right.\
    \ I want to let you guys know, by the way, you're looking at our incredible horse\
    \ trough right here behind us. It is, we're going to do some baptisms a little\
    \ bit later. I'm going to explain what that is. If you're wondering about that,\
    \ some of you came here like, I'm not sure what about baptism is. That's a weird\
    \ thing these Christian people do. You're going to see it. And some of you might\
    \ be like, I should do that. By the way, it's not like an oil change you have\
    \ to do every 3000 miles. I'm like, well, I haven't done it in a while. I guess\
    \ I should do it again. You only need to do it once, you know, but whatever. But\
    \ anyway, let me just see. The water is nice and tepid. And no one will burn themselves\
    \ and it's not cold. Okay, a lot to get through. Here we go. I have to zoom through\
    \ this message. We're in the middle of a series. Let's start right here. I'm going\
    \ to, remember everybody be really quiet. I want you to hear something. When you\
    \ know the name of this song, if you know it, just raise your hand. Don't shout\
    \ it, but just name it. If you know the name of it, okay? It's going to be going\
    \ on for a little while. Listen. You get credit. I'll call on you in a second.\
    \ Listen to this melody. Jump to the next one. This song is 15 minutes long. I'm\
    \ only going to show you like little chunks of it. But notice how it builds. Stay\
    \ with it. Once you get the melody, you can hum it. Go to the next one. Yep. There\
    \ you go. Jump to the next. We're now in minute nine of this song. Last one. All\
    \ right, that's good. Okay. Now, the song, like I said, is 15 minutes long. It's\
    \ going to be going on for a little while. Listen to this melody. Jump to the\
    \ next one. Jump to the next. The song, like I said, is 15 minutes long. And that's\
    \ all it does. The song just builds from that little phrase. And it just builds\
    \ the whole time. All the way through for 15 minutes. Back here. You raise your\
    \ hand. Do you know what that song is? Bolero by Ravel. Maurice Ravel. Yep. Now,\
    \ here. Yeah. Let's close in prayer. That's it. Let's get some baptisms going.\
    \ Now, that song, again, like, some of you, how many of you guys heard that song?\
    \ Maybe you didn't know what it was. Yeah, that song. Everybody's heard that song.\
    \ It's one of the most famous classical pieces, you know, of recent past. I mean,\
    \ it's really famous. But the whole song, again, is just this single phrase over\
    \ and over again. The whole work adds, builds, adds, builds, until it gets to\
    \ the whole orchestra doing the same thing over and over again. In other words,\
    \ to understand that song, all you would need to do is just understand that song.\
    \ All you would need is that one phrase and to see it built over and over and\
    \ over again. We'll come back to that in a minute. Three weeks ago, we started\
    \ a series, and we just sort of said, look, let's reimagine the Bible a little\
    \ bit, which is such a strange piece of ancient literature written over, you know,\
    \ 1,500 years, 40 or so different authors in different places and settings and\
    \ times. And it's hard for us to read the Bible because we're not reading it as\
    \ the original audience member. We're 21st century, Western kind of world people\
    \ looking back at this thing. We're not the original audience. And the, like,\
    \ one of the sort of Bible scholar, a guy named John Walton says, look, the Bible\
    \ is for us, 100% Bible is for us. But it's not to us. The Bible was, was definitely\
    \ written for us, but it's not written to us. And so that makes it a little bit\
    \ of a challenge. But we know Christians regard, they have high regard for the\
    \ Bible, they'll say things like this, about this is the Bible saying, this is\
    \ what people believe about the Bible, it's in the Bible. Hebrews 412. For the\
    \ word of God is alive and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates\
    \ even to the dividing soul and the spirit, joints and marrow, it judges the thoughts\
    \ and attitudes of the heart. Now, if people believe, Hebrews 412 just says, if\
    \ people believe that it actually did all this stuff, that's a pretty high, that's\
    \ a pretty high level of importance for some words. That they actually can do\
    \ all of these things. So Christians are known for people who have a high regard\
    \ for the Bible. But some of you might be like, look, the Bible is maybe sort\
    \ of wonderful, but it just sort of feels like a collection of mythological stories\
    \ and I don't really know about that. Others of you might say, well, the Bible\
    \ might be valuable, but it just, I mean, come on, let's get it with the times\
    \ here. It's for different people. You just said, Jeff, it's not to us, it's written\
    \ to people a long time ago. Maybe it needs a little updating, a little freshening\
    \ up. For a lot of people, that's sort of their belief. Other people might say,\
    \ look, and this might be a larger portion of us. People are like, look, the Bible\
    \ is really good, but it's so unapproachable. It's just so very much unapproachable.\
    \ And as we think about it, the Bible, as we've been saying, maybe one of the\
    \ ways we got to reimagine or rethink about the Bible is less as a book and more\
    \ as a bookstore or maybe perhaps like a library with different sections. Because\
    \ if we were to look at it, here are the different sections of the Bible. All\
    \ of them have different kinds of writing styles. Each one of them requires its\
    \ own unique way of looking at it. You couldn't read the writings on narrative\
    \ the same way you'd read the writings on prophecy or gospels or etc. Things like\
    \ that. So once again, between law and narrative and prayer and wisdom and prophecy\
    \ and gospels and letters and apocalyptic writing, they're all different styles\
    \ of writing. And what we've been saying throughout the series is this. Each section\
    \ of the Bible requires its own unique approach to understand it as best as possible.\
    \ In fact, so much confusion about the Bible often comes with the fact that people\
    \ have complicated it by coming to a particular section with the wrong approach.\
    \ And all we're trying to do in this particular series is to kind of say, let's\
    \ just try to make sure our approach is lined up with the thing that we're reading.\
    \ Now, one section of the Bible, I think is probably the toughest section of all\
    \ of the Bible writing to read. It is complicated largely because a lot of it\
    \ is written in poetic language. It references things that we have no idea what\
    \ they're talking about because again, for us but not to us. But as we look at\
    \ it, I just want to show you when we get to this kind of reading, what you're\
    \ going to see over and over again is a phrase. Over and over and over again like\
    \ Polaroid that starts small and begins to build and build and build. And I'll\
    \ show you what that is in a moment. But when you read this most confusing kind\
    \ of writing, which is called prophetic writing in the Bible, when you read it,\
    \ it is so helpful to understand that single phrase. Now most people, so by the\
    \ way, to just give you a sense, in the Bible there are 16 books of the Bible\
    \ that are written that would fall into this category, prophetic writing. Four\
    \ major prophets and 12 minor prophets. They're not because they're minor because\
    \ they're like less important. It just usually has to do with their length, mostly.\
    \ But anyway, here's a list of them. The ones that are in the yellow, the yellow\
    \ orange color, that's all the major prophets. So Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.\
    \ Daniel is the other one that has an asterisk there because some people put that\
    \ book in particular in another category. But that's, you know, thank you for\
    \ kneeling down by the way. That was really helpful. No one saw you. Yeah. Yeah,\
    \ that was great. Anyway, I know you're trying not to have anybody draw attention\
    \ to that. It's okay. Anyways, there we go. The other 12 of those are simply referred\
    \ to sometimes as just the 12. You'll see it actually referred to as the 12. These\
    \ are the minor prophets. Now, for most people when you talk about prophetic writing,\
    \ most people have the impression, and we talk about prophecy, if you looked it\
    \ up like a definition of prophecy or prophetic writing, inevitably the first\
    \ definition you would find would be talking about or predicting events in the\
    \ future that happen at some point, you know, at some point in the future. But\
    \ here's what's so interesting. When it comes to the prophetic writing in the\
    \ Bible, only one percent of the predictions that are in the Bible have yet to\
    \ occur. There are lots of people that you might know or come across. You might\
    \ even be a person who really loves the idea of future prediction in the Bible,\
    \ and there's definitely some of that, but it's really an overwhelming minority\
    \ of the amount of things that are in the Bible about future prediction. Only\
    \ one percent of stuff hasn't happened yet. Here's some really conservative Bible\
    \ scholars on the subject. These guys wrote a book called How to Read the Bible\
    \ for All It's Worth. Really good book. It's not thrilling, not a page-turner,\
    \ not great summer pool reading, but it is in fact really helpful. But anyway,\
    \ it often happens that many Christians refer to the prophetic books only for\
    \ their predictions about the coming of Jesus. Now, what people would read the\
    \ Bible, you know, sort of prophecy books for is they would like try to read it\
    \ only as if it's anticipating Jesus, who doesn't show up in his ministry for\
    \ about, depending on which prophet you're reading, between 400 and 700 years.\
    \ So he's saying, these are what these guys are saying, it happens that many Christians\
    \ refer to the prophetic books only for predictions about the coming of Jesus,\
    \ as though the prediction of events far distant from their own day was the main\
    \ concern of these prophets. In fact, using the prophets in this way is highly\
    \ selective. Consider the following statistics. Less than 2% of Old Testament\
    \ prophecy. Old Testament is the part of the Bible that concerns God and his relationship\
    \ with his own people before the ministry of Jesus, life and ministry of Jesus\
    \ and the early church. That's the New Testament. Old Testament is about God and\
    \ his relationship with his people before the ministry and life of Jesus. Now,\
    \ less than 2% of Old Testament prophecy is messianic. That is to say, referring\
    \ to a messiah that's supposed to come. Less than 1% concerns events yet to come\
    \ in our time. The prophets then did indeed announce the future, but it was usually\
    \ the immediate future of Israel, which is the northern kingdom of Israel, Judah,\
    \ which is the southern kingdom, and other nations surrounding them that they\
    \ announced rather than our future. Meaning there's so many people have an obsession\
    \ with only about 1% of the content of the writing. Which means that when it comes\
    \ to prophetic writing, it's referring to something else altogether. In fact,\
    \ something that would be way more helpful to look at it when you are, if you\
    \ ever come across some of this writing in the Bible, is to look at it a little\
    \ bit differently. Now to say it simply, prophetic writing is about God's word\
    \ spoken through God's spokesperson to God's people. That's the simplest way to\
    \ talk about what prophetic writing is. A prophet is simply a person who's been\
    \ appointed by God to speak his words to his people, and it's like I said only\
    \ rarely is it about future stuff. Like that hasn't happened. It's very rare.\
    \ When it comes to the actual tone of this writing, when we're talking about the\
    \ prophetic writing tone, it's highly confrontational. It is unbelievably confrontational.\
    \ Because God's people were intended to have a relationship with God that looks\
    \ like wedding vows. We talked about this in the beginning of the series about\
    \ what it means, what's called the covenant. And there's covenant, what are called\
    \ stipulations or vows, and they're saying we're going to be, it's going to be\
    \ you and us, God. We're going to be together. And they set up these terms and\
    \ they're going to have this agreement. And the prophets come around and they\
    \ go, hey, wait a second. You guys are, you guys are supposed to keep up your\
    \ end of the bargain and sort of be a part of this relationship in the way that\
    \ you intended. So it's always confrontational. They're like, look, you stopped\
    \ caring for the poor, the orphan and the widow, which is like the trifecta of\
    \ the most marginalized people. You aren't caring for the poor, the orphan and\
    \ the widow anymore. Or you've made some other idols and you're worshiping them,\
    \ or you're practicing some kind of permission, you know, immorality, whatever\
    \ it might be for yourselves. And so the prophets words are not welcome words.\
    \ People aren't like, yay, a prophet's here. They're always being confronted.\
    \ In fact, here's an example of some people having a conversation in the Bible\
    \ about prophets and how they feel about them. Check this out. This is in 1 Kings\
    \ 22 verse 7. Jehoshaphat asked, is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here\
    \ whom we can inquire of? The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, oh, there is\
    \ still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because\
    \ he never prophesized anything good about me, but always bad. I don't want to\
    \ ask that guy. He always says things I don't want to hear. This is over and over\
    \ again. To be a prophet is to be a person who's generally hated because all that\
    \ person does is show up and say, you guys aren't getting it right over and over\
    \ again. Christy Anya Buile in her book, literally says it like this. I love this.\
    \ God used prophets to speak the cold hard truth to God's cold hard people. Over\
    \ and over again, you see this and what it is, the content of the prophetic messages\
    \ is always what people needed to hear, but what they rarely wanted to hear. It's\
    \ what people needed to hear, but what they rarely wanted to hear. Now when we\
    \ talk about the prophets, it's important to understand, we talked about this\
    \ in the second week of the series, about the idea of this last week, about how\
    \ they all the whole Bible fits into a giant narrative framework. And I want to\
    \ show you what that is. Once again, if you weren't here with us here, it is really\
    \ quickly. First, God is the good creator and sustainer of all things. Second,\
    \ God's people, God and people form an unlikely and unequal partnership with him.\
    \ Third, people break the partnership with God. At some point, they're like, we're\
    \ kind of tired of this. Four, life apart from God results in exile, means they\
    \ get deported out of their own homes, or invasion, people come in and take them\
    \ out like they take them over. Five, by the way, people regret their decision.\
    \ And then six, God restores the partnership. You can see this cover to cover\
    \ in the Bible. If you get this, if you get this sort of framework, you understand\
    \ the Bible a lot. They see you don't need to kneel down. They see you don't need\
    \ to kneel down. Just walk right out. That's there you go. Just there you go.\
    \ I don't know. So now what I said was helpful for us before is this, and I meant\
    \ it, and it is a little bit goofy, but if you think about the basic plot line\
    \ as a romantic comedy, it really helps you to understand, which I know a lot\
    \ of you are going to be watching romantic comedy on Father's Day. I just know\
    \ it's a typical tradition in a lot of people's homes. No, just kidding. Now,\
    \ when you talk about the prophets, when they show up, it's the same part in a\
    \ movie, in a romantic comedy when the person, the protagonist breaks up with\
    \ whoever they're with. He breaks up with her, she breaks up with him, they go\
    \ back to their old life. Inevitably what you have is another person will say,\
    \ are you crazy? That's the best thing that ever happened to you. Why? It's a\
    \ secondary character, tertiary character is like, you should not have broken\
    \ up with that person. You've never been better in your whole life. I can't believe\
    \ you broke up with that person. You've got to get back with them. That's what\
    \ the prophets say in these chunks of that story. The people are like, I'm done\
    \ with this partnership. And they end up in sort of exile or invasion. And then\
    \ people regret their decision. The prophets are like, no, no, no, wait, come\
    \ back, come back, come back. That's the language. But there are other pictures\
    \ of God's people and their relationship too. That isn't just sort of this romantic\
    \ comedy kind of picture, although that's really prominent. In fact, that's the\
    \ third most used sort of reference to God and his people is as a husband and\
    \ a wife. That's actually how he describes his relationship. The first most used\
    \ picture is of a shepherd and a sheep. This is the relationship God has with\
    \ his people. You see it over and over again in the prophets. But the second most\
    \ used one, which is maybe particularly significant today, is that it's a father\
    \ and child. Throughout the writing of the prophets, there is this constant theme.\
    \ Again, you see that sort of begins to get developed. And one of the things is\
    \ as a father and a child. Here's Hosea chapter 11. Verse one says this, when\
    \ Israel was a child, I loved him. Notice the language. And out of Egypt, I called\
    \ my son, but the more they were called, the more they went away from me. You\
    \ get this very clear picture of what prophecy actually is. Israel is called a\
    \ child and then he called out of Egypt, I called my son, but then they, they\
    \ wandered away. They broke up with me. Now what's so incredible to think about\
    \ this is that if you have a picture of this idea of this sort of confrontational\
    \ tone, but as a father to his own kids, you could describe that or characterize\
    \ it as simply tough love. Now some of you have been, someone just treated you\
    \ like a jerk and they're like, that's just tough love. That might not have been\
    \ true. Like being a jerk is not the same thing as tough love. Just make sure\
    \ we're all on the same page. The operative thing here is love. It is not licensed\
    \ to be a jerk, but part of loving another person sometimes is having the willingness\
    \ to say the tough things. Having willingness to say the tough things. That's\
    \ different than the way the world is now. The world says if you, if you, the\
    \ world would sort of basically categorize love as a kind of blind acceptance\
    \ and aloof permissiveness. And if you were ever to say something, I don't know\
    \ if that's okay, then that makes you an unloving person in the world's eyes.\
    \ But we know that there is something really true about the idea that sometimes\
    \ we need to hear the tough things because of love. And when we encounter them\
    \ in the Bible, these tough things, it's so unbelievably important that you and\
    \ I understand that the beating heart of the Bible is the calling of wayward kids\
    \ home to their father. The language might get really harsh. The words might get\
    \ really tough. And if you were to extract just a little one or two of those words\
    \ out of the Bible, you'd be like, what's this Bible all about? And that's true.\
    \ But if you're to look at it in a bigger, broader sense that this is about God\
    \ calling wayward kids home to the father, then it becomes a little bit clearer\
    \ what we're doing. And that refrain starts to take on a little bit more shape.\
    \ And there's a command that does all of the prophets build their particular message\
    \ on. And it's one word. It's the word that just starts out very, it starts really\
    \ sort of simple and clean, and it just keeps getting built on and expanding.\
    \ And that word is this word in Hebrew, teshuvah. Over and over and over again.\
    \ The root word of teshuvah is this simply this word, turn. All the time. In fact,\
    \ you can keep seeing it throughout the writing. You just see this word turn comes\
    \ up over and over again. Return or turn. What this looks like in the book of\
    \ Hosea, which I'll show you in a second, is this. After a long series of painful,\
    \ tough love things that God is saying through his prophet Hosea to his people.\
    \ I mean, if you were to read the subject headings in the book of Hosea, you would\
    \ just see what the subject headings are added way later. You just see things\
    \ like punishment or anger or frustration that God has for Israel. It's like,\
    \ these aren't the ones that people get tattooed or needle point onto a thing.\
    \ These are like, wow, this is really harsh stuff. It is really harsh. No question\
    \ about it. But after a long series of this painful, tough love stuff, then comes\
    \ this promise. The very last chapter of Hosea looks like this. I'm going to show\
    \ you this. Notice the language. Hosea 14. Return. Shuvah. Return Israel to the\
    \ Lord your God. Your sins have been your downfall. Take your words with you and\
    \ return. Shuvah to the Lord. Say to him, forgive all our sins and receive us\
    \ graciously that we may offer the fruit of our lives. Remember, this is the prophet\
    \ speaking to the people in God's voice. Say, forgive our sins, receive us graciously.\
    \ Assyria cannot save us. We'll not mount warhorses. We'll never again say our\
    \ gods to what our own hands have made. What they're saying here is this. They\
    \ would make a thing out of wood or stone or something like that or iron and they\
    \ would say, this is our God. Make it and then call it. This is our God. We just\
    \ made this. What they're saying is we're not going to have these idols anymore.\
    \ We're not going to ever say again our gods to what our own hands have made.\
    \ For in you, the fatherless find compassion. It continues. Then God's voice switches\
    \ to his own voice. I'll heal their waywardness and love them freely for my anger\
    \ has turned away from them. I'll be like the dew to Israel. He, Israel, will\
    \ blossom like a lily, like a cedar of Lebanon. He will send down his roots. Who\
    \ is wise? Let them realize these things. What you get is that the invitation\
    \ is a coming to confess and anticipating what God will do to receive them. That's\
    \ what that is. That's the words of the prophet at the end of that book. Let me\
    \ just ask you though, just right now in this moment, a tough love message from\
    \ God to me might say something. Turn from blank. Now you might be wrong, but\
    \ if you had to guess, if there was a tough love message to you right now from\
    \ God, it might be like this. Turn from blank. What is it? Is it a habit? Is it\
    \ an addiction? Is it a kind of bitterness? Is it a self-righteous kind of judgment\
    \ about other people? Is it a sense of your own kind of elevated, I'm so wonderful,\
    \ isn't it great to be me? It's too bad for everybody else? Is it a thing you\
    \ keep going back to? You can't stop, you just keep going on back to it. You keep\
    \ trying to get away from it and you're, like a lot of us, we kind of give ourselves,\
    \ which just tends to be our typical things. We tend to give ourselves a little\
    \ bit of permission. I'm not that, so I get to do this. We keep going back to\
    \ it. This is true of me. It's true of all of us. Maybe it's, in some cases, it's\
    \ a really good thing. It's like everybody would acknowledge the thing that you\
    \ keep going back to, or the thing that you hold on to is really good, but it's\
    \ become the ultimate thing. And in that sense, it's become something that was\
    \ never intended to become. And maybe God's just sort of saying, maybe you ought\
    \ to turn from that. Shoo, turn. Now it's no surprise. Jesus has the continuation\
    \ of the same message, even in his own teaching and his own ministry. The same\
    \ phrase is. Comes up again. Now remember, here's the Hebrew word for to Shoova\
    \ or turn, Shoov, turn. That word in Greek, when you go to the Old Testament,\
    \ part of the ministry, part of the life of the Bible between God and his people,\
    \ there, you know, all that story before Jesus ministry. And then the life of\
    \ the early church, which is the New Testament. The New Testament is written not\
    \ in Hebrew, but in Greek. And that word looks like this in Greek, metanoia. Now\
    \ when I show you the actual, the actual English version of the word metanoia,\
    \ remember what you're looking at is turn, turn. I'm going to show it to you.\
    \ And some of you will recognize this word, but you've not heard it in this term\
    \ before. That word is repent. Now you've heard this word before, some of you,\
    \ but it sounded like this, repent, repent. There was like some sort of, usually\
    \ it had a really deep South anger kind of attached to it and repent, you know,\
    \ like it's like a big threat, you know, like coming at you. And you heard it\
    \ that way. I just want to say when you look at it from the way that the Bible\
    \ comes at it, it's just simply saying the word metanoia is just a whole life\
    \ U-turn. I was going one direction and I'm done going that direction and I'm\
    \ turning the other way. Metanoia, return. Here's Jesus's own words at the very\
    \ beginning of his ministry in Mark chapter one. The time has come, he said, the\
    \ kingdom of God has come near. By the time it's coming, it's come to fulfillment.\
    \ The kingdom of God has come near. Repent, U-turn and believe the good news.\
    \ Now with that being said, the turn is just when Jesus is inviting people to\
    \ this, what he's saying is remember the big arc of the Bible, you don't have\
    \ to live like orphans anymore. You don't have to live like orphans at all. And\
    \ in that sense, repent isn't a threat, like maybe some of us have heard it or\
    \ characterized it. It's really an invitation to come home. The problem with Jesus\
    \ over and over again is that people look to Jesus and were like, you keep inviting\
    \ the wrong people to come home because they're too far gone. Over and over again,\
    \ Jesus, you keep telling people you can turn back, you can come back and the\
    \ critics of Jesus always were like, wait a second, you can't tell those people\
    \ because they have gone too far. They cannot turn. And maybe that's how you felt\
    \ about yourself. Maybe someone made you feel that way. Maybe you understood that\
    \ God is like, look, he's for some people, but I know what I've done. And every\
    \ single person in this room has some measure of some secrets in here that if\
    \ people found out about him, we would all be devastated. The criticism always\
    \ of Jesus is that he kept associating with people and inviting people who everybody\
    \ else had regarded as too far gone. Over and over again, Jesus reiterates that's\
    \ not possible to be too far gone. What's important to keep in mind in the invitation\
    \ about sort of returning, what's so crucial to keep in mind is returning always\
    \ involves leaving, meaning you can't stay in one place and also be in another.\
    \ Some of you might be going to like Hawaii this summer and we're all jealous\
    \ of you. That's great. We're excited for you to go there, but you can't decide\
    \ to go there and be there and also be here at the same time. You're going to\
    \ have to decide to leave one place to go to another. That's what returning is.\
    \ Returning always involves leaving. And there's also in the early church, then\
    \ there's another way of depicting this whole journey. You know, Shuv or Teshuvah\
    \ takes on, it's a dramatic symbol and a return from an old life. It's this way,\
    \ the New Testament, the early church begins to characterize this idea of turning\
    \ around. It's the word baptism. Baptism. Now the word baptism gets actually clarified\
    \ here. Looks like this. Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into\
    \ Christ Jesus, that's not referring to the dunking of people underwater or a\
    \ wonderful horse trough like we have. It's referring to something else. The word\
    \ baptism, which will get symbolized very much quite literally because the word\
    \ baptism literally means the word to immerse or to place into. When they're talking\
    \ about people being baptized into Jesus, the way this is written here is it's\
    \ saying you have been placed into, you have been fully immersed in the person\
    \ of Christ Jesus as it says right here. Through faith you are fully immersed\
    \ in the person of Jesus. It further gets more extreme. Again, remember we're\
    \ talking about coming home or returning. Don't you know that all of us who are\
    \ baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? That's weird. I understand.\
    \ Let me clarify even further. We were therefore buried with him through baptism\
    \ into death. In order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the\
    \ glory of the father, we too may live a new life. Now all that is to say is when\
    \ we through faith in Jesus are put into his own life, we're buried with him just\
    \ like he was buried and then raised to walk in a new life. So here's how I illustrate\
    \ this every time we do baptisms. Some of you will recognize this. Hold out your\
    \ hand just like this. Everybody do it just so you get them. You're going to do\
    \ this. It's going to be really helpful. Now all in faith we're buried with Christ\
    \ in baptism. Remember he died on a cross, buried with Christ in baptism, all\
    \ of our sin and death. By the way, if you're being baptized, it's how long I\
    \ hold you under the water. Deep breath. So at this point right now all buried\
    \ with Christ in baptism raised to walk in a new life. People are buried under\
    \ the water and raised to walk in a new life. That's what you're doing. What is\
    \ happening in baptism is the symbolic representation of being baptized into Jesus.\
    \ You've been baptized into Jesus, buried with Christ in baptism, raised to walk\
    \ in a new life. That's all that that is. By the way, this is our new cult wave.\
    \ If you see each other, we all know you belong. Okay, no, anyway. Leaving and\
    \ burying old things, being raised in a new life in Jesus. The invitation on this\
    \ Father's Day, and you're going to see people get baptized in a minute, the invitation,\
    \ you can do it too if you're like I'm not sure if I should, you know, I haven't\
    \ done this. I'm not sure if I should be baptized. If you're not sure, but you\
    \ have already said yes to Jesus, then you should do it. And you're like, but\
    \ my hair, I'm going out to brunch. It's fine. Everybody, it's cool. Everybody\
    \ will think it's cool. Don't worry about it. We'll even give you a t-shirt. Okay,\
    \ so anyway, now the invitation at Father's Day is two words. And if you could\
    \ get this, it's the message of the prophets. It's the summary of all the instruments\
    \ and the chorus coming together. That same melody played all the way out and\
    \ blown up into huge ways. The huge, the message of the prophets and the message\
    \ to you on Father's Day. In a moment, we'll see the baptism, which will culminate\
    \ in that baptism is this, this two word phrase. Come home. Come home. Come home.\
    \ Some of you needed to hear that. You haven't heard that in a long time. Come\
    \ home. Maybe for some of you, it's the first time you get to come home to Jesus.\
    \ You never really thought about it in those terms. You thought about it like\
    \ I got to get my act together. Man, I got it because then I can come home. And\
    \ the invitation isn't to do that. It's just to simply come home. Just, hey, leave\
    \ that old life and come on. We'll take care of the rest of that stuff. Maybe\
    \ you're tired of wandering around. Come home. Maybe even searching for some answers\
    \ and you keep coming up empty. And we say it all the time around it. We do not\
    \ have all the answers. We just know that we belong into a life with Jesus. And\
    \ so maybe for you, that's a person for you. You're like, I don't know what to\
    \ do. I'm feeling still pretty empty. Come home. Maybe you're trying to make sense\
    \ of a life that you're living and you're trying to figure out how to justify\
    \ it or trying to figure out, trying to convince yourself that it feels amazing,\
    \ that it is great. But you know deep down it's not the life that you want. Trapped\
    \ in relationships, lost in a particular kind of loneliness and calling it success\
    \ or calling it whatever. Come home. Maybe you felt unwanted or unworthy. Every\
    \ one of us in here has cut stuff. Like I said, we've all got secrets that if\
    \ people knew about it they'd be horrified. We've all given ourselves some permission\
    \ at some point. Never too far gone. Come home. Come home. Baptism is a symbol\
    \ of someone who has come home, who has left one place and arrived at another.\
    \ It is the transformation that God has done but is not yet finished in a person.\
    \ It is not magic. It does not make someone a Christian. It is a symbol of what\
    \ God has done. And maybe for some of you the first step isn't, just because you've\
    \ already maybe you haven't come to this first step, but the first step is probably\
    \ just simply saying I want to come home. Maybe you celebrate it with baptism,\
    \ but let's start with coming home. Would you pray with me and then we'll have\
    \ some baptisms and we'll talk about coming home. Jesus, in so many areas of our\
    \ lives we get lost and lonely and we wander and we need you to come get us. So\
    \ we want to leave our old life. It's not as we don't know how. Father forgive\
    \ us that we tried to make sense of things in a way that we did not know what\
    \ we were doing. We screwed it up. Forgive us. We need your forgiveness. We want\
    \ to come home. Maybe for the first time in your life you don't have all the,\
    \ you don't know much about the church or the Bible or anything else, but you've\
    \ got a sense that God might be calling you home to Him. Maybe for the first time\
    \ it's just yes Jesus I want to come home. Father though baptism is something\
    \ that maybe a lot of us have done or maybe we've seen before, might we continually\
    \ live a life that is dying to old things and stepping into new things that you\
    \ call us to by the power of your spirit Jesus. Father we get to celebrate now\
    \ this milestone in people's lives as they're buried with you in baptism and raised\
    \ to walk in a new life. We're grateful that that's the work you do in an ongoing\
    \ basis in our life Jesus. In your name that we pray right now amen. Folks we're\
    \ gonna do some baptisms. This is gonna be pretty cool. If that's something you\
    \ want to do and you're like I didn't plan on it just head over there we'll get\
    \ you all checked in. We'll put you in this super warm water in our glorious horse\
    \ trough okay. Let's get some baptisms going. Will you stand as we celebrate and\
    \ sing together. I've got nothing new how could I express oh my gratitude I could\
    \ sing these songs as I often do Chang's \u015B I've got one response \u015B I've\
    \ got two answers \u015B I've got one response \u015B I've got two answers \u015B\

    \ a heart singing Hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah I love you Lord For your mercy\
    \ never fails me All in my days I've been held in your hand From the moment that\
    \ I wake up Until I lay my head Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God And all\
    \ my life you have been faithful And all my life you have been so, so good With\
    \ every breath that I am able Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God Oh I will\
    \ sing And all my life you have been faithful And all my life you have been so,\
    \ so good With every breath that I am able Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God\
    \ Of the goodness of God Oh I will sing Of the goodness of God Oh I will sing\
    \ Of the goodness of God Applause That's so fun. By the way, if you're a person,\
    \ we don't have time to do anymore. But we have another service. So in 50 minutes\
    \ we can do another one. If you're like, I should have done it. But if I get a\
    \ message from God to get baptized, this is your message from God right now. Okay,\
    \ I just want to tell you, this is it. This is the miraculous moment you're waiting\
    \ for. You can still do it next year. We have one more service to do this. So,\
    \ but we do have to make some room for the 1130 service. So here's what I want\
    \ you to do. Would you hold out your hands? Would you receive this as a blessing?\
    \ If you're not comfortable with this, that's okay. However you want to hold your\
    \ hands, that's all right. Would you receive these words as a blessing to you?\
    \ From the prophet Isaiah who writes these words. I made you and you are my servant.\
    \ I will not forget you. I've swept away your offenses like a cloud and your sins\
    \ like the morning mist. Return to me for I have redeemed you. Sing for joy you\
    \ heavens for the Lord has done this. Shout aloud you earth beneath. Burst into\
    \ song you mountains, your forests and all your trees for the Lord has redeemed.\
    \ He displays his glory. Wherever it is that you might wander, find yourself being\
    \ wayward, lost, lonely, overwhelmed. If you ever wonder to yourself, I've gone\
    \ too far. There is no too far that God's love cannot reach. He calls you home\
    \ to him. Whatever it is that you encounter, may the love of the Father and the\
    \ grace of the Son and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy Spirit be among\
    \ you all in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you guys. If you have needs for prayer,\
    \ we'd love to pray with you. Come back next service. We got more baptisms to\
    \ do. God bless you."

  transcript: 'Good morning, Harbour Point, come on, all over this room, would you
    stand up and put your hands up for a little bit more?

    Together, we come to celebrate the one that we believe in. That is Jesus Christ.
    Come on, put those hands.

    Let''s sing.

    If you believe, won''t you put them together?

    Yeah, I believe in crucifixion.

    By His blood, I have been severed.

    I believe in resurrection.

    Hallelujah, if a life is death to me.

    Let''s sing all praise.

    Hallelujah, yes I do.

    Hallelujah, I believe in Him.

    I believe in the hope of heaven.

    He''s preparing the place for me.

    Far beyond my heart''s imagine.

    Here''s a bird and night I see.

    I believe that He''s going.

    His return is to blame, it''s bright.

    Light the altar, keep it burning.

    See the light, the rose of holy light, yeah.

    All praise to the Father.

    All praise to Christ the Son.

    All praise to the Holy Spirit.

    Our God has overblown.

    The King, the Word, there is, and never more will be.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe, yeah.

    I believe in You, Lord, and I trust You.

    I believe in You, though I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

    How could I ever walk away?

    Will the Word have saved my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    No, I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus.

    How could I ever walk away?

    From the Word who saves my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    No, I''ll never be ashamed.

    Of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

    How could I ever walk away?

    From the Word who saves my life?

    No, I''ll never.

    All praise to the Father.

    All praise to Christ the Son.

    All praise to the Holy Spirit.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

    And Jesus, writing in, I believe.

    I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe.

    I believe in you.

    How can you believe in Jesus today?

    Won''t you give him some praise?

    We serve a God that is more than able.

    Now unto him who is more than able to do exceeding,

    abundantly, how baffled we can ask for things.

    Continue on our worship and sing unto the Lord.

    We trust you to depend on the Lord.

    The Son.

    When did I start to forgive?

    All of the great things you did.

    And when did I throw away my faith for Him?

    In the gospel of love?

    And how did I start to believe?

    You were to fish and fall.

    And why do I talk my sick?

    How can I forgive you?

    How can you believe in God?

    You are more than able.

    You are more than able.

    Stay it again.

    You are more than able.

    Oh, hear the people today,

    waiting loud.

    You are more than able.

    So who art to deny what the Lord can do?

    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
    oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

    Thank you, Lord

    If my grandma was here and she wouldn''t sing it like this

    She would say, because she lives

    I can face tomorrow

    Because Jesus lives

    All of my fears, they''re gone

    Because I know

    I know, I know

    He holds you in His future

    In life

    It''s worth living just

    Because Jesus lives

    It''s an old song, old song

    I''m 33, but I got an old soul

    I love those songs, you know

    Can I say one more time, just receive it

    Receive it, let it encourage your spirit

    Back in the black church, we just used to sing songs

    When people get excited, because it was the truth

    Because He lives

    Someone needs to hear that

    I can face tomorrow

    Because Jesus lives

    All of my fears, they are gone

    They are gone

    called

    A Back of Angry Beasts

    Alright, hey everybody, how''s it going?

    Yeah, you guys chose a 10 o''clock service, you love traffic, you feel like it''s
    raining

    We can get some traffic going to start my week off in the right way

    Just prepare your heart a little challenge immediately

    Like, how am I gonna put to test the fact that I just learned something about
    Jesus

    But to find a parking lot that''s miserable and work my way out of it

    And you did it, you found it, way to go

    Glad you guys made it, those of you guys are in the tent, glad you guys made it

    Those of you in the balcony, I see you guys up there, glad you guys made it as
    well

    It is so good to be with you guys and for those of you guys who are online

    Of course, we say this every single week

    The best expression of our church is that we get a chance, whenever we get a chance
    to be together

    Because the people of our church are amazing, and really you guys are

    I''m really grateful to be with you guys, so fun

    If you''re, and I know you had to drive today through a puddle

    You had to activate the all-wheel drive feature on your car

    And you made it, it''s incredible, so great stuff happening, let''s get right
    to it

    We have a lot to cover as we talk about this

    By the way, if you''re new with us, I''m Jeff and I just want to make sure we''re
    clear

    We do not have all the answers, this is not a church where we have everything
    figured out

    Here''s what we know, we''re looking at Jesus, we believe we were made with conviction
    for life with Jesus

    And that requires everybody to help us along the way

    Everybody''s got a next step in that, so whether you''re new, whether you''re
    checking out Jesus

    You''re investigating the church or whatever, we are convinced everybody''s got
    a next step to take

    Our hope is that you find this to be a community of people who don''t have it
    all together

    Who are work in progress kind of people doing that stuff

    So, however that is, grateful that you''re here, let''s get right to it

    I want to show you a commercial from 1990, and I just want you to notice, just
    pay attention as you watch this commercial

    Some of you will recognize it, and if you recognize it, you''re an old person

    Okay, but, I recognize it, it''s fine

    But I just want you to notice, I want you to take in all of the anxiety in this
    commercial

    Check this out, okay, here we go

    Mary Clary thinks her zipper bags are the best, and will never switch to Gladlock
    zipper bags

    That''s right, never

    Mary Clary, what do you say we lock you in this phone booth here, with either
    your bag filled with angry bees

    Or a Gladlock bag filled with angry bees

    See that green color chain seal there, Mayor? That shows you the Gladlock bag
    is closed

    Your bag doesn''t have a green seal

    You know, change is good, I''ll take the Gladlock zipper bag

    Just kidding, Mayor

    When it really counts, don''t get mad, get Gladlock zipper bags

    Okay, some of you remember this commercial

    Now, what I want to, obviously it''s a goofy commercial, and I''ll help you by
    over-analyzing it and taking it way too seriously

    Okay, that''s the gift I bring

    But, let''s look at this for a moment

    This ad is a question about which bag, it''s a question about bag choice

    Which one has a better seal, the yellow and green seal, or the yellow and blue
    seal, which makes the green thing

    Which all of us were convinced we needed back in 1990, and it was so crucial

    And in fact, as you look at this, this question is about which bag

    Would you rather have hold the angry bees that we''re going to give you

    And secondly, we''re going to put you into this phone booth, which you''ve somehow
    agreed to do this

    The whole premise of this whole thing is based on an incredibly disturbing idea

    That these people who are making this scenario happen, not only have they got
    bees to give a person to hold

    But also they have the power to convince this person they should get into a phone
    booth

    And for those of you who don''t know what a phone booth is

    It''s like an elevator that doesn''t go anywhere, that''s all that it is

    It''s the same thing, you''re talking on a phone but it''s in a tiny little space
    and nobody else joins you in there

    But in any event, they have this power to lock this person into a phone booth
    to which they''re agreeing to do

    And the whole question, the whole, how is this okay with everybody?

    How is she not like, why don''t you just take all the bees and go away, I don''t
    want to do any of this

    I don''t care what bag you use, I''m not doing this, this whole thing is stupid

    The power dynamic, everything, like I''m going to convince her and we''re going
    to lock her in this thing

    How is she not just like, no, I''m not doing that

    The question is, and why are people saying yes to this

    And the question, over the whole scenario, which again, I realize I''m taking
    it too seriously

    The question is, well who''s in charge here? Who thought this was a good idea?

    Who thought this would be okay? Who gets bees and then makes them angry by shaking
    them and handing them to a person

    And says, then we''re going to lock you in a phone booth, the whole thing is bizarre
    and absurd

    And who''s in charge here

    Now that question, who''s in charge here, is a critical question when it comes
    to anxiety

    Who''s in charge here?

    We''re in week two of a series called The Bag of Angry Bees and it''s a series
    on anxiety

    Because nothing really kind of captures the idea of anxiety like a bag of angry
    bees

    But I want to catch us up a little bit, if you weren''t here last week and make
    sure we''re all in the same sort of playing fields

    As we talk about this idea of anxiety

    One of the things we said last week was this, is that we have to differentiate
    between fear and anxiety

    Fear is the response to something that has happened

    Like bear, person with a knife coming after us, oh my gosh that''s fear

    Anxiety is, what if there''s a bear, what if we go there and there''s a person
    with a knife?

    That''s anxiety, are you with me? One''s anticipating a thing, one is responding
    to a particular thing

    And we said generally what happens when we''re talking about anxiety is that the
    thing that''s happening

    Or even the thing that''s a concern is a reasonable concern

    But in anxiety we take that up to an unreasonable response level

    Or an unreasonable sort of anticipation level, are you with me?

    Now, we also said this, it''s so important to keep in mind that all anxieties
    have something in common

    Every single anxiety is really about having a low tolerance for uncertainty

    It''s about a low tolerance for things that are not certain

    And for those of us who have anxiety, we know people that do, we know that statistically

    All of us know someone who is suffering from some form of anxiety

    It''s one in three teenagers and one in five adults, this is the statistics, most
    current statistics on this

    Which means you work with people, know people, you live next to someone, you have
    someone in your house perhaps

    Or you yourself as someone who has anxiety

    And as we talk about it, more than likely depending on how you grew up or where
    you grew up

    What kind of healthy environment you might have encountered

    Some of you got the experience of, or at least the impression that if you do have
    anxiety

    The best solution is simply as people have told us or we''ve understood is simply
    snap out of it

    Just stop having anxiety, just stop, just don''t, just get over it

    It''s a thing, sure, but be really great at doing stuff

    Compensate by being high functioning

    And just live in society with this thing and never really deal with it

    Because you shouldn''t have to deal with it, just snap out of it

    And some of us got the impression, either by our own thinking or because someone
    told us

    We were told, here''s what you should do

    Just find some people in the world who have greater anxiety than you

    And then by comparison, you won''t care anymore

    You know, there''s conflict in the Middle East, yeah, it''s pretty anxious for
    those people

    So I guess I don''t get to deal with mine, which never really deals with either
    of the anxieties

    In either case

    And if you''re a person who grew up in the church and you talk to a person who''s
    like

    You know, like you had enough courage to tell a person who''s a Jesus follower

    Who maybe they''re a little misguided, but you''re like, hey, I just want to let
    you know

    I''m suffering from something I think is anxiety or maybe depression

    And they were like, I have a Bible verse for you

    Don''t be anxious about anything, thank you so much

    And they''re like, well, don''t be anxious

    But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your
    request to God

    And you''re just like, well, I don''t know what you''re supposed to do with that

    I guess I''m not supposed to have this, because the solution to having anxieties
    apparently just don''t

    And if I don''t know how to deal with that, then I have to kind of hide it away
    and deal with it as a shame thing

    Because I''m not supposed to have it, and so it never really gets dealt with at
    all

    The truth is, all of us have some question about anxiety at some level

    And here''s what we know, that if a person with anxiety was to answer this question

    Who''s in charge?

    A person who''s suffering from anxiety, if they were asked the question, hey,
    who''s in charge?

    What they would say is, and again, I''m paraphrasing, but to say it this way

    My feelings or my thoughts are in charge, I''m not in charge, not me, I''m not
    in charge

    I''m freaking out here

    And this is where it starts, this is where anxiety begins to become kind of an
    issue

    In other words, probably another way to say it is this

    Anxiety has a double effect

    There''s the anxiety that we feel, and then there''s the way we feel about our
    anxiety

    To say it this way, I''m freaking out about freaking out

    And this is why people get stuck in it

    It''s not just that I''m freaking out as if that was enough

    It''s that now I have anxiety about my anxiety

    Like, what am I supposed to do with this thing when I can''t control and all of
    it starts to spiral

    And you maybe have this experience, or do you know people who do

    And here''s what I want to do today

    I want to give us one tool

    It''s not the answer to everything, it doesn''t solve all the anxiety

    It''s just one really underutilized, very accessible tool

    That also requires a pretty significant amount of courage as well

    It''s just gonna, and just again, to make sure we reiterate

    I''m not an expert

    Someone told you were doing a series on anxiety

    You might have thought you''re like, maybe you''re new and you''re like, I''m
    not sure about Jesus

    But I''ll come here that and you thought, they told you I''m an expert on this

    I''m not an expert, I''m not a therapist, this is not my degree

    I''m a fellow traveler in this

    I do a little bit of research on some stuff

    I''m looking at the Bible when it comes to this sort of thing

    My wife and I walk through our own anxiety, different journeys

    But I do want to point to some ways of addressing anxiety today

    And it''s kind of a next step building on what we did last week

    But I also want to tell you this, fair warning

    The way we''re gonna get to this one tool is a very windy road

    Some of you are familiar with the way that I do this sometimes

    I don''t appreciate the laughter

    It''s fine, it''s fine

    But you''re gonna be like, what in the world are we doing?

    And then I promise I will bring it back home

    But you''re gonna wonder for a little bit

    Because I''m gonna start in a place you may not expect

    And then we''re gonna get there

    So I''m gonna start in ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

    Because that''s where you thought I was gonna go

    Here''s what we''re gonna do, I''m totally serious

    Ancient Near Eastern Temple construction

    Here''s what happens, it happens in six phases

    This is the first of the phases, it starts like this

    It''s the boundary making of a particular thing

    Here''s where things are, here''s where things are

    This separates the sacred space from the not sacred space

    Boundary making

    Then after things are sort of put up, there''s some filming

    There''s some filling of things and some further separation of things

    There''s either, sometimes there''s interior spaces

    Which are separated from other spaces

    All this is pretty typical in the Ancient Near East

    And the sixth phase of the Temple construction

    Whatever it is, whatever god that''s being worshipped there

    You typically, it''s placed within there on the sixth phase

    So there''s typically a six or seven day phase of this sort of creation

    Sort of the creation of a temple

    And on the sixth phase, this is when the statue is placed into the temple

    To give people an idea of what god is going to be worshipped in that temple

    Now, there are six days, there''s a seven day creation

    But there''s a six day creation narrative in the Bible

    Let me show you what happens on the sixth day of creation

    So god created mankind in his own image

    And the image of god, he created them male and female

    He created them, this is the sixth day of creation

    Now, let me pause right here for a second

    What''s being said by this, many scholars agree

    That the whole cosmos, by looking at the creation narrative in the Bible

    Which some of you are like, I''m not sure I''m buying into that yet

    That''s okay, don''t worry about it, just stay with me on this

    That the whole cosmos, the Bible will say, is god''s temple

    The entire thing, no temple could contain him

    So the whole cosmos is his temple

    And instead of a statue on the sixth phase of the creation, sixth day

    It''s a person, people become the representation of this god

    In his temple, the whole cosmos

    But the people aren''t just a decoration, there''s more, verse 28

    God blessed them and said to them, be fruitful and increase in number

    And fill the earth and subdue it some translations

    And have dominion over it

    Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky

    And over every living creature that moves on the ground

    So this, the people aren''t just simply decoration

    There''s more there, they''re blessed and they''re told to multiply and have dominion

    And the answer to the question, who''s in charge of all of the created stuff?

    The answer is, people are

    People are supposed to have dominion over to subdue this creation

    In fact, the only thing to which people are supposed to be subject to

    Is god himself, other than that, they''re supposed to be over all of these things

    It''s gift to Genesis chapter 2, where it gets a little bit more specific about
    some of this stuff

    Verse 19, now the Lord God had formed out of the ground

    All the wild animals and all the birds of the sky

    And he brought them to the man to see what he would name them

    And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name

    So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild
    animals

    Notice what''s happening here, there''s something about this man

    This created, this image of God placed into this whole cosmos

    Which now has this responsibility to name everything

    Again, this might be a challenge for some of you

    Like I''m not sure I believe, just stay with the point of what''s happening here

    Because here''s what''s happening in naming

    Naming is a very crucial thing in the Bible

    Now what happens in all naming, now at least of which the Bible is this

    The first thing that happens is this, there is a differentiation from a thing

    So when someone names a thing, it says this is a that and I''m not that

    That''s not me, over there is that, I can separate that thing, whatever it is
    from me

    That''s separate from me

    Those are animals, I''m not, that''s animals, I''m me

    Does that make sense, this is differentiation, you''re different than me

    That''s what''s being said, when we name a thing

    Secondly what happens in naming is sort of an authority over

    Probably better said is it implies they''re taking responsibility for a thing

    So the naming of a thing not only creates a differentiation, I''m not that, that''s
    not me

    But it also implies some level of authority over the thing being named

    This is why if you have ever read the Hebrew scripture, the Hebrew Bible

    The Old Testament, the Old Covenant

    Part of what you get in that part of the Bible is you get this really interesting

    Kind of conversation about names

    Not least of which is the name of God

    Which is kind of if you read Moses'' interaction with God

    In the burning bush story, perhaps you''ve heard of that story before

    But one of the things Moses keeps asking God is cool

    What do I tell people your name is as if to say

    Because it''s a secret thing that never gets really totally disclosed

    It''s so unbelievably important and sacred

    In fact, to this day, you will find

    Very observant Jews who will not refer to God even by the name God

    They''ll refer to God as this word, Hashem

    Who in that word simply means the name

    Like we don''t even want to whisper, say the name of God

    Because it''s so holy, it would contain him and he is beyond containment

    So the word simply to describe God is just the name

    Names are crucial

    Names have all sorts of relevance in the Bible

    But you know this, even nicknaming has rules

    Some of you have nicknames, you had a nickname growing up

    Maybe you still go by that nickname

    Maybe introduce yourself as a particular name

    Maybe, you know, like, but there''s some rules that go along with that

    You know that there''s rules about that

    Now the first rule of nicknaming is

    You don''t get to choose your own nickname

    You don''t get to decide

    Like I don''t get to say, you guys just want to let you know

    Now I''m going by MacGyver

    Kind of rhymes with McGuire

    Plus the guy could build a glider out of, you know, like the gum

    And like a, you know, rubber band

    And he could like, oh look, let''s fly away and escape

    He never used a gun, he just, as long as he had like a

    Like a scuba tank, he could save the world

    You know, I''m going by McGuire, you guys are coming by McGyver now

    Woo, I''m just going, you know that doesn''t work

    That''s not how it goes, you can''t choose your nickname

    You don''t get to choose it, it has to be bestowed upon you

    And the way it always works is sort of a top-down method

    Either the leader, the group of a person is like

    You''re now this, or the group decides

    Hey, we''ve decided you''re going by this nickname

    You''ll get to choose it, you can''t declare it

    It''s what we''ve all decided because it''s a top-down method

    It''s the way it''s worked, it never gets to be the other way

    It''s always sort of top-down, the power group is sort of

    Ascribing a nickname to a person

    And there''s always, it tends to be, not always

    But tends to be a moment of like kind of mockery

    That''s based in truth a little bit, like it''s sort of

    A little bit funny, but it''s based in truth

    It always sort of connects, there''s a dotted line to that

    You know, so I can never figure out, even to this day

    Why my 12-year-old soccer coach called me lanky

    I can''t figure out what the truth was

    In there, I don''t really know, that''s weird

    Anyway, so anyway, where was I going?

    Now, nicknaming, you don''t get to choose your own name

    Right, you guys watch Seinfeld and you know, maybe you saw

    George try to be called T-Bone and never really kind of panned out for him

    The top-down method is how this works

    Remember this, this is going to matter in a second

    And there''s always an element of sort of truth and mockery

    That kind of goes with nicknaming, we know this stuff

    Now, in Luke chapter 8, Jesus encounters a man

    This man is what we would call demonized

    He''s possessed by a demon

    And what you see with this man is he''s naked, he''s living in the tombs

    He doesn''t have a house, he''s all by himself

    Now, important side note, in our sort of secularized, late modern world

    We have a tendency to do something when it comes to the idea of demonization

    Or, you know, demon possession

    A couple of different things

    One of the things we tend to think, looking back into the Bible as we go

    Look, they don''t have sophisticated psychological analysis

    Anytime anybody had something, sort of some sort of mental illness

    They would just naturally ascribe it to demon

    That''s a lot of demon, that''s what that is

    And I just want to say, you might be right

    But I also want to just propose something else

    The Bible does talk about a spiritual dimension of reality

    That is beyond even what we kind of know and experience on a regular, ongoing
    basis

    And sort of are visible, or there''s an unseen world of things that are happening

    And I also want to say that mental illness is not necessarily demonic

    People who suffer from mental illness aren''t necessarily being demonized, so
    to speak

    And yet there is still in the Bible this description of things

    That where demons, spirit beings are at work against what God is trying to do

    And here''s what I just want to say

    The one does not exclude the other

    There is mental illness that they don''t know how to diagnose back in the first
    century

    And there is also demonic activity that''s also at work

    So I just want to make sure we''re all clear on that

    Are we okay moving forward with this?

    Okay, good, here we go

    Now, here''s the scene, Luke 8, 26

    They sailed to the regions of the Jeresians, which is across the lake from Galilee

    This is in the northern part of Israel, there''s two big lakes

    There''s the Sea of Galilee and then there''s the Dead Sea

    The Dead Sea is way bigger, but the Sea of Galilee is much more important

    Because things live there

    And on the opposite side of the lake, which literally sometimes is just called
    the other side

    This is where people don''t go very often

    But when Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town

    For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house

    But had lived in the tombs, this is going to come up again

    This is this person who lives by himself, naked in the tombs

    And this man runs up to Jesus

    And when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of
    his voice

    What''s important to keep in mind

    When you see this, and the story is also in Mark 5

    You can read this story, and one of the things that''s crucial when you see it

    Is there''s always this really difficult distinction between

    It''s hard to tell whether the demon is speaking or the guy is speaking

    Who''s talking here? Is the demon or is it the guy?

    What I want you to see is I think that''s kind of important to kind of keep it

    It''s important to like know that that is confusing sort of on purpose, okay,
    with me

    Now, when he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top
    of his voice

    What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God?

    I beg you, don''t torture me

    So this is such an interesting kind of encounter

    Some scholars will say that this elaborate naming by this demon

    Is an attempt to gain control over Jesus

    Which of course fails miserably because he doesn''t know rule number two

    It''s a top-down model, you can''t, Jesus is over everything, you can''t do this

    This is what''s going to be shown in a moment here

    But there''s this sort of crying out of Jesus'' name as an attempt perhaps to
    gain control over him

    Verse 29

    For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

    This is what''s sort of like an out-of-order sentence

    Like the reason why this guy is saying this is because of this

    So Luke is recording what happened

    He''s like the reason why this spirit is crying out to Jesus, don''t torture us
    or whatever

    Is because of this right here

    For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man

    And many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept
    under guard

    He had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places

    Let''s pause here for a second

    So often what a flicks people drives them into isolation and loneliness

    So often what a flicks people drives them to isolation and loneliness

    It isn''t that the man was like, oh man I feel like I got a thing

    I got a ghost

    It''s that the thing itself drove him into the solitary places to be alone

    Then Jesus asked him

    What is your name?

    Legion he replied because many demons had gone into him

    The word legion to talk about a Roman legion is about roughly five to six thousand
    Roman soldiers

    So the idea of this means that there''s a ton of demonic activity in this particular
    person

    What is your name?

    The question that''s being asked here is who''s in charge

    Things are out of control, Jesus steps in and he is clearly taking control of
    the moment

    And Jesus doesn''t need the name of the demon which is sort of to fly in the face
    of the whole idea here

    The demon actually, and the demon gets no control over Jesus because of, you know,
    he''s able to like name him

    What''s being said here is that there is in fact Jesus who is all, he is over
    the whole thing

    And takes control of the moment

    And then there''s this tragic comic kind of thing that happens next

    Is that the demon does get cast out, but it gets cast out into a herd of pigs

    Which are nearby apparently

    And then the pigs run into a lake and drown

    That''s the story, they''re like, we''re possessed!

    And they drown, that''s it, I mean that was a galloping pig by the way

    If you guys are wondering, that''s what galloping pigs look like

    And they run away and they drown

    Now, the question that you have, which is a fair question is

    What does this have to do with anybody''s anxiety?

    Let me tell you, one of the things that happens in anxiety is this

    One of the things that occurs in anxiety is that there tends to be a fusion, a
    linking and overlapping

    Between the thing that''s afflicting a person who suffers from anxiety or depression

    And that person themselves, they make it their identity

    It''s one of the most tragic things that happens

    One of the things that Amanda pointed out to me in her own anxiety journey

    This is my wife, she said

    I realized I had to stop just being, like I just sort of made my anxiety

    I''m an anxious person, I''m just anxious, I''m always anxious, I''m anxious

    She finally had to realize maybe that wasn''t the way I was supposed

    Maybe I wasn''t made, God didn''t make me anxious

    This was something that was a problem that needed to be addressed

    Fusing the two things together

    Curtis Chang in his book, which I mentioned before

    I think we have a couple of copies in the lobby if you want to read them

    Or take one, borrow one, you can borrow one, you steal it, we''ll know

    No, just kidding, but if you want to borrow it, it''s fine

    But we have a couple, his book''s great, but here''s one of the things he says
    to this very effect

    When we have been, notice the language, mentally abducted by anxiety for extended
    periods

    I love the language

    We identify so thoroughly with the anxious thoughts that our minds fuse with these
    thoughts

    The more we rehearse an anxious narrative, the more we play it over and over and
    over

    We talked about this last week, about ruminating, the more we rehearse an anxious
    narrative

    The more we become indistinguishable from the narrative, whoa

    The more we repeat the thing over and over in our heads

    The more we become indistinguishable from that narrative

    Such that we cannot abandon those thoughts

    And this mental fusion can be so complete, we sometimes don''t even recognize
    that we''ve been hijacked

    In other words, when we start having anxious thoughts that we keep playing over
    and over and over again in our heads

    And it starts to fuse with our identity, we have trouble differentiating

    You can see where this is going, we need a way to separate our identity from the
    affliction that is upon us

    And find a way to rein it in

    So here''s what we need to do

    Name it

    Name it

    We have to call the thing, whatever the thing is, we have to call it what it is

    So that we can separate it from ourselves

    Here''s what Curtis Chang says once again

    When we can name our thoughts, we recognize them as distinct from us

    Differentiation

    We''re meant to recognize our anxious thoughts as things that they may roam in
    our minds

    But they''re not us in our entirety, something distinct from us, differentiation

    There''s a critical difference between a thought present within us and a thought
    becoming us

    When I named my anxious thoughts, he says, I began to experience a sense of authority
    over them

    The more I could stand outside my anxious thoughts, observe them and label them

    The more those thoughts began to lose their power to terrify

    The more I watched those thoughts with detached observation and not engagement

    And the more I said, oh, I recognize you, the more the anxious thoughts faded
    away

    So let''s call it what it is, we''ve got to name it

    Got to name it

    And the question you have, which is a fair question, is how do I name it?

    I just feel like I''m freaking out, I don''t know how to name this thing, what
    am I supposed to do with it?

    And I just want to tell you, again, we''re just going to look at kind of, this
    is the very beginning stages of stuff

    But let''s just talk about this for a moment

    One of the most helpful ways to figure out where you might have anxiety is to
    do this, is to find where there is friction in your life

    Where are things not going smoothly? Where''s their friction?

    In other words, take it a different way

    Can you identify a pattern in your life where you''re regularly agitated, afraid,
    etc.

    Where there''s probably a disproportionate response to a particular thing?

    For instance, if you''re going through Del Taco and you''re like, they gave you
    the wrong hot sauce

    And you''re like, that''s a bummer, they gave me the wrong hot sauce, I want a
    del scorcho

    And they gave me regular old lame hot sauce

    And you''re like, that''s a bummer, that''s an appropriate response

    If you''re like, they didn''t give me del scorcho, I''m burning the place down

    By the way, that''s a serious offense when you don''t get del scorcho

    Okay, but I''m just saying that there''s a moment where you''re like, my response
    should be a two, but it feels like it''s a twelve

    This is probably where you''re going, maybe there''s something in here where I''m
    trying to figure out what''s going on here

    There''s a pattern where I''m overreacting, it should be a two and I''m giving
    it a twelve out of ten

    Something''s a problem here and there''s different triggering events for all of
    us

    And they''re all different kinds of scales

    For me, confession, okay

    I have to be very, very careful

    Anytime I''m in any kind of competition with my children

    Because there''s a part of me, and I''ve told you guys this before, if you''re
    with us last week, I said

    The thing that I''ve been naming recently over the course of my life is that what''s
    been chasing me is this right here

    Being a disappointment and being irrelevant, these are the things that come up
    with

    Now, in a competition, anytime you can seem incompetent or be a loser

    Not just lose, but be a loser

    It''s right into this stuff

    So, I have a level of intensity with my own kids in competition

    Which is really, I have to measure, and some things I can''t do

    Whether it''s like, doing things that''s like an activity we do together, like
    surfing

    It''s like, my kids are all better surfers than me by a long shot

    But I''m like, you know, I just, I''m frustrated that I''m not as good as they
    are

    They''re in there, like, my oldest is twenty

    He lives, like, it goes to school right next to the beach

    He surfs constantly, he goes to school in a wetsuit sometimes

    I''m like, what is wrong with the world?

    Anyway, but he does that, he''s awesome

    And my other kids are incredible, all the things they do

    And I''m like, I''m out, and it''s like, I''m making it a competition and I have
    to win

    We''re playing cards, we''re playing horse, and how much does it matter if I''m
    like

    Playing horse with my son, how important is it that I win?

    Crucial is the answer to that question

    But it should be a two, and it''s a twelve, why does it matter?

    I have to be very careful with these things

    Where''s their friction, name it, you have to find some of the friction

    It''s probably one of the most helpful things you can do

    But there''s another layer to this, and this is where it gets even a little bit
    more difficult

    And it''s nonetheless crucial, and by the way, I have to apologize in advance

    Before I give you this, I''m going to show you it in a second

    It rhymes, okay?

    And I always am afraid when it rhymes, like, oh gosh

    We just packaged this up in a little neat little thing

    And there''s probably a little tiny little, if you look closely

    A little TM on the top right of the circle around it, like trademark

    There''s nothing, I just want to make sure, I want you to make sure you remember
    it

    But for those of you guys that have a high, like really sensitive cheese meter

    This is going to set you off, okay?

    It''s very cheesy, but it''s really crucial, okay?

    So bear with me, okay? You guys ready for that?

    I think you can handle this, okay?

    So not only are we finding the friction, where is there this ongoing sort of pattern

    Where I''m overreacting to certain things

    But bear with me, probably what is more crucial than that

    Is to find the fiction behind the friction

    I do not appreciate that, sir

    Because behind every single anxiety is a perfect lie

    Behind every anxiety that we feel is a near perfect lie

    Like, wow, that makes so much sense that I would have anxiety about a particular
    thing

    And the thing that people, it may not be you, but people that are around you

    That might suffer from anxiety, they''re believing a particular lie

    That''s being rehearsed over and over again in their head

    And it''s nearly perfect, and the question we have to ask

    Which is a very courageous question, which may require actual therapy

    You might have to go to a person who can help you uncover this stuff

    But the point is, there is 99%

    I''m going to go 100%, okay?

    There''s a fiction behind this friction which is causing you anxiety

    There is a perfect lie behind it

    And to ask the question, where is the lie that''s fueling this kind of anxiety
    is crucial

    Behind the anxiety is a particular lie

    I''ve showed you kind of my own thing that''s chasing me down, and it''s a lie

    Let me give you some things to think about

    If you''re having trouble kind of identifying it, this is not going to answer
    every question

    But maybe some of these you might connect with, okay?

    Here

    If blank happens, it means I''ve lost control

    And when I lose control, the whole world goes at just whatever

    I have to be in control

    And if something happens, it means I''ve lost control

    It could be any number of things for you, it can be small, and it can be big

    It can be I''m late for dropping my kids off for school, I''m late for picking
    my...

    It could be I''m late for school, it could be if I screw up a homework assignment
    that I''m supposed to turn in

    It could be if I don''t connect with these people, if I mess up my own

    If I don''t get on Instagram enough times, or I don''t see these things, it means
    I''ve lost control

    Some of you might have this scenario, there won''t be enough

    I know what will happen, there''s just not going to be enough blank

    Filling whatever you want there

    Money, attention, affection, love

    I know that if I say yes to this now, then there won''t be enough later

    Or if this person says yes to this in my life

    There''s only a certain, there''s like a pie of the amount of whatever it is that
    I need

    And if they take a slice, it''s going to be one less thing available for me, or
    for anybody else

    Or just won''t be enough of whatever it is

    You can, maybe that''s you

    Some of you have this, if I can''t blank well, whatever it is

    I''ll be alone

    If I can''t do well as a student, if I don''t perform well at my job

    If I''m not a good friend, if I don''t appear wonderful, if I don''t do beauty
    well

    If I don''t do personal health and fitness well

    If I don''t do living the California life well, then I''ll be all alone and people
    won''t want me

    That may be you

    Some people have this one, it just connects with a lot of people

    Things are going so great, but now what?

    Like I know everything''s awesome, but that only means there''s an impending doom
    right around the corner

    I feel like things are going great, my friendships are great

    Maybe you''re single and you''ve got all your crew of friends, you''re like, we''re
    getting along great

    And we have this community of people that we get to be around and it''s so amazing

    It''s all going to go, something''s going to happen immediately

    Maybe you''re a person who''s got a mom group and you''re all hanging out

    Things are incredible, you''ve got your kids and your marriages are incredible

    And you''re like, it''s a matter of time before everything goes away

    There''s going to be disease, there''s going to be a volcano, there''s going to
    be something that swallows us up

    We''re all going to die, I just know it

    There''ll be a puddle on the way to church, I mean, you never know

    A lot of people have this, things are going great, but they can''t forever

    Just waiting for the house of cards to fall

    That''s an anxiety

    Some people have this, that there''s a sense that I''ll never be understood no
    matter what I do

    However, I try to communicate who I am, I''ll never be fully understood

    Which is a matter of being not loved and being alone

    Once again, I just cannot be an understood person

    And this is leaving me in a particular kind of anxious state

    Some people have this

    What if I or we never get through blank?

    We''re a tough patch in our marriage

    I''m in a deep spot of loneliness in my own life

    I want to meet Mr. Wright, I want to meet Mrs. Wright

    I want to be around these people

    But I''m in this tough spot of loneliness and I can''t get through it

    What if we never get through it?

    What if the tough spot of my marriage or the disease or the illness, I never get
    through it?

    What if that never happens?

    I''m just preparing myself to never get through because I don''t see the light
    at the end of the tunnel

    So what if I never get through it?

    All of these things generate all kinds of fiction behind the things that we''re
    worried about

    And they generate for us a kind of anxiety about this stuff

    And for some of you, it may not be you

    Like I said, you may not be the person who''s got anxiety

    You may have a high tolerance for uncertainty and all that kind of stuff

    But you probably live with people and you''re like, why are they reacting like
    a 12 when it should be a 2?

    Because there''s probably a fiction behind it that''s generating that sort of
    thing

    Now, what do we do with that?

    Now, this is really important

    What we do with that depends really crucially on your own impression of how you
    perceive Jesus

    Some of you are like, look, I''m okay with Jesus that came because you''re talking
    about anxiety and some cool stuff

    But I just want to tell you, there''s a dimension that we''re going to talk about
    here

    Which is so important to understanding what it is to walk with Jesus

    Because there''s a spiritual dimension to faith

    It is not just practical help for all these kinds of things

    You go to lots of places to get that

    And we''re okay with that, by the way

    We''re a church, we''re kind of okay with Jesus

    But I want to try to give you a sense of what we talk about next

    That''s going to push this a little further

    And I think it''s probably, for some of you, maybe like an invitation to step
    into something you''ve not yet considered

    But here''s what I want to do

    Remember, when you look back at the story of Jesus with this demonized person

    This man who''s naked in the tombs

    It''s Jesus who extracts the name of the demon

    Jesus doesn''t need the name to be able to take control, which is really important
    to keep in mind

    But Jesus extracts the name of the demon, the demon says his own name, Legion

    The guy doesn''t do it

    The demon''s the one who drove him into isolation

    He''s the demon, he''s the naked demon guy living in the tombs

    Doesn''t live at home anymore

    And even the guy couldn''t name the thing

    Jesus has to draw it out of this person

    And maybe for you when it comes to naming some of this stuff

    You actually need some supernatural assistance to do it

    You actually need this

    This is what Jesus really can do

    And the inner stuff, all this stuff, it''s hard

    It requires courage and humility

    And this is perhaps an invitation for us to consider today

    Let''s go back to Philippians 4, 6 and 7

    Do not be anxious about anything

    But in every situation by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving

    Present your request to God

    And the peace of God which transcends all understanding

    Will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus

    What''s so crucial to keep in mind is

    Every anxious person loves the second part of that

    The peace of God which transcends understanding

    We all want that

    Even if you''re not an anxious person, you''re like, that sounds great

    The peace of God which is beyond even my own understanding

    I want that

    But what I want to do today is this

    During everything in mind

    I want to focus on this part of that verse

    Prayer and petition

    When most of us think about prayer

    We think about petition

    Which is asking for a particular thing

    Petition means I''m asking for a particular thing

    The language of petition is in the First Amendment

    The right to petition the government is part of what''s in there

    Like that actually gets to ask for a particular thing

    To make something, to make a request, a formal request of a thing

    Which is part of what''s being described here

    In fact, even it says, make your request known to God

    But there''s also something else there

    It says prayer and petition

    Which they''re under the same umbrella

    But there''s something different about the two things

    Which is worth thinking about

    Because for a lot of us, all we think about is prayer

    Is while I ask God for stuff and then hope he delivers

    And I''m ready for a couple different answers

    You know, like maybe you heard that growing up

    It''s like, yes, you can have what you want, no you can''t

    Or you just have to wait around a little while

    It''s like, that''s all we know about prayer

    I don''t want to say that there''s a beautiful part to that

    But I just want to kind of expand it a little bit broader than that

    Because maybe in prayer what we get to do

    Is to seek God to do something that''s beyond asking him for stuff

    Or to just simply solve a thing

    One of the things we get to do in prayer

    Is actually to ask God to reveal something to us, about us

    Which means we''re not asking, we''re just listening in effect

    Here''s what the Psalmist writes in Psalm 139

    These famous words, search me God and know my heart

    Test me and know my anxious thoughts

    See if there is any offensive

    Some translations have the word hurtful way in me

    And lead me in the way everlasting

    Like there is some way through the anxiety

    To be led in an everlasting and eternal kind of life

    Not just forever, like someday far away

    But right now in the present

    To say it differently, again, another rhyming thing

    Please buckle your seatbelt, I apologize

    Please read this, okay, stay with me

    All healing, whether it''s like a medical

    Like you broke your foot, you got an ear infection

    You got a heart condition, all healing begins with revealing

    We have to sort of come to grips with the thing that we''re facing

    So that it can be addressed

    This is part of the naming process, right

    And it''s scary because we have to see it for what it is

    So here''s what I''m going to do, I''m going to give you a prayer

    It is a two-word prayer, you can practice it whenever you want

    However you want, I''m going to give you a rundown

    On how to do it right now in a second

    But it''s a two-word prayer that requires some courage

    And it''s different for a lot of you than maybe you haven''t yet understood what
    prayer is

    And here''s what it looks like, you ready?

    Search me

    Search me

    There''s something that needs to be revealed to me

    That I can''t find on my own to be named

    So that I can differentiate it from myself

    And I need God to reveal it in me

    With tenderness, with care, not with shame

    Not with condemnation, but with love

    That gets drawn out

    So, that in mind

    Let''s pray

    I''m going to give you a moment, just as your eyes are closed

    To sit in the stillness of this

    If there is a contrast between the loudness

    And the voices of anxiety, it must be stillness

    And silence

    Jesus

    Search me

    Search me

    Jesus that I might find where there''s friction

    Search me, Jesus, that I might find where there''s friction.

    Search me, Jesus, to uncover the lie, the fiction that''s undergirding that friction.

    When I can''t name them, will you name them, my anxious thoughts, Jesus?

    Will you lead me in the way everlasting?

    Father, would you hear us now as we just simply say in our own response to you
    in the stillness that we are so rarely do we find it in our lives?

    Would you hear your name?

    The name that rescues, that breaks through into the darkness, Jesus.

    Jesus.

    It is in your name that we pray, Jesus.

    Amen.

    Let it break, and your name still, call the seed of still, the rage and need of
    still, every way.

    And your name, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    We call these bones to live, and call these lungs to sing once again.

    I will praise Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Would you do this? Would you just stand together?

    One of the things that, you probably heard me say this before, if you''ve been
    around, which is when we''re singing, we''re setting our collective prayer to
    music.

    That''s all we''re doing.

    And there''s some real power in the prayer of people being uttered at the same
    time, in the same place.

    There''s something that happens in that, and I don''t know how to explain it,
    I just know that it does.

    And so all I want us to do is to maybe just to raise a little bit of our voices,
    to sing that one more time together, and then I''ll close out our time.

    So would you lead us in that?

    We sing Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    You silence fear, Jesus, Jesus.

    You make the darkness tremble, Jesus, Jesus.

    Would you hold out your hands and would you just receive this blessing?

    Where there is darkness that needs to tremble, you can call in the name of Jesus.

    Might you experience the light that he intends to bring into the darkness of anxiety
    and depression and loneliness and isolation?

    May you have the courage to utter the phrase this week to God, search me and know
    my anxious thoughts.

    See if there''s a hurtful way inside of me and lead me in the way everlasting.

    Whatever you''re up against, may you know, may it be conferred upon you the love
    of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship and comfort of the Holy
    Spirit in Jesus'' name.

    So good to be with you. Amen.

    So great to be together. We''ll see you guys later.
